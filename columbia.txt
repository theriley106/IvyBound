I was accepted early decision, received a call from admissions this morning. In a pretty great mood right now/trying not to think of how I'll afford tuition.

My stats:

Age: 24
Major: Psychology
Previous college: UT El Paso (6 credits), Schoolcraft College Fire Academy (20 credits), EMT and Paramedic programs (certification only.)
Previous work: Firefighter/Paramedic, city of El Paso, TX (2 years) prior to that volunteer firefighter/full time paramedic student back home in Michigan
Financing: I didn't expect to get in, so I'll have to get back to you guys on this one...
ACT/SAT: Above average, not amazing (1360 SAT, 26 ACT)
High school: nothing amazing, 3.2 or so GPA, no AP credit 




_____ACCEPTED______

The Dual BA program is by far my first choice! Should we post our stats?

A reply on an old thread said that most accepted applicants have average 2190 SAT or 32 ACT, come from private schools, and have at least a 4.0 weighted GPA (info came from the admissions director, 2014): http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/columbia-university/1531234-columbia-sciencespo-dual-degree-fall-2014-p2.html 




_____ACCEPTED______

Hooray! I found my home.  I was accepted to GS a couple weeks ago- it's all coming down to financial aid for me, but I was hoping to meet some of my potential classmates if I end up going.

I'm a very hard worker, 4.0 GPA, but I'm not gonna lie- this VERY HARD WORKLOAD thing is starting to intimidate me..I have kids, as I thought a lot of GS'ers did, so am I going to have to completely miss out on their lives for the next few years in order to graduate from Columbia?
(..however, that last part does still sound incredible- graduating from COLUMBIA..hahaha awesome) 




_____ACCEPTED______

Hey guys,

I met with a Senior Admissions Officer about this program - Erica Rosen - and it's true that they're working out some things for themselves still. She had to research a bit to respond to some of my questions.

Here's what I learned: You cannot apply to both the dual BA program and regular GS (kind of duh) BUT if you are not accepted to dual BA, the admissions committee can decide to refer you to GS. This is important to me because it seems that the dual BA program will be very competitive and my primary goal is to go to Columbia. I am a transfer student from the University of Southern California, and she does not know how transfer credit will factor in. I'm prepared for the situation that none of my transfer credits will apply and that I will go through the entire four years of the program. Also, it is unclear if you can take some classes in French at any of the three campuses (important to me because I speak French and would love to be immersed in it all the time). That will be something of a special request once you are actually there. Finally, she does not know how many students they will accept, but it will be a small program the first year. I read a published article stating 60 students from each university will be sent to each other (so 60 will be accepted by Columbia and start immediately at Sciences Po, 60 from France will be accepted by Sciences Po and start at Columbia) but randompiglet says they will only accept 30 so now I don't know. 30 sounds way worse to me 

I'm curious about the backgrounds of the other applicants here on this thread? Like I said, I'm a transfer from the University of Southern California and I'm on a leave of absence for one year. I have an 3.7 GPA and good SATs, Erica just expressed concern that I am a "nontraditional" student since I am so young - 19 (I went to university early, when I had just turned 17) - but I have no doubt that I am, so I'm just working to get that across clearly in my essay. I'm interested in the dual BA because I want to work in diplomacy one day, and also be fluent in French.

Bonne chance

Hi all, I'm an International student (French also) in a US college right now but I can't apply to this dual-degree w/ Sc. Po as I can't leave the US in the next years. Most definitely, Sc Po is not looking forward to getting "non-traditional students" in the sense of GS and the application will be highly based on tests scores, GPAs etc. So I was wondering what you expect from this dual-degree at the undergrad level, and why don't you apply to it at the Masters level (Columbia SIPA & Sc. Po) after a great BA @ Columbia GS?

greets from France! 




_____UNKNOWN______

I was in a similar position. When I applied to GS four years ago - I have since graduated from Columbia - I had a 2.9 cumulative GPA. I had 12 W's and 5 F's from 10 years prior. Yes, you read that correctly, 12 W's and 5 F's. I was kicked out of school, worked for 8 years, and enrolled into my local community college (SMC) and maintained a 4.0 while taking 52 units. I transferred to Columbia - I got in pretty quickly after I sent in my app and I did not even have to interview. My upward grade trend and my essay pretty much explained everything. I am now at Notre Dame Law School on a full-ride scholarship.

If I got in, you stand a great chance. Schools - as evident from my brief academic history - like people who "turn things around." 




_____ACCEPTED______

Whats up guys! I'm in the same boat as you all, applying EA for GS. Good luck! Here are my stats:

I speak 3 languages.... English, Greek (fluent), Spanish (fluent)
If accepted to GS, my intended major is Financial Economics. I look to become an investment banker

**Give me your thoughts on my credentials and I'll do same for you!





_____ACCEPTED______

Hello everyone! I'm new to CC and thought I'd add my stats:

-I took 2 years off after high school due to some personal issues I was going through
-High School GPA: 3.35 (going through a hard time was what really dragged my grade down though, and I tried to explain that in the autobiographical essay)
-CC GPA: 4.0 (38 credits completed, I took the max 18 credits last semester, receiving all A's, and got permission from the dean to take 19 this semester)
-SAT/ACT: I didn't take either. I just took the GSAE at the campus last week though.
-EC: Phi Theta Kappa member, member of a volunteer club on campus, Women's Leadership Development program (I also have a mentor from this)
-Volunteer: at foodbank and with the volunteer club on campus
-Awards: I've been on the President's Honor Roll (min. 3.5 after taking 20 credits) for several semesters now.

My EC's are weak but I'm hoping my grades/GPA/essay will help me get accepted though. The main reason I don't have a lot of EC's is because I spend the majority of my free time studying so I either don't have time or it doesn't fit into my schedule. What do y'all think my chances are?

Hey everyone! I recently joined this website seeing that most of the people here are just as "worried" about admissions as I am. I, as well, applied for Columbia GS Early Action for the Fall 2015 admission. Here's my stats as well--since it is currently trending, after all--and please don't hesitate to let me know what you think!

- 6 years off to serve in the military (very outstanding military career, if I do say so myself  )
- High school GPA: 3.5/3.8 weighted
- CC GPA: 4.0 (35 credits)
- SAT/ACT: 1750 (took > 7 years ago)
- Part-time job: Certified Pilates instructor & physical trainer
- EC: Phi Theta Kappa Member
- Volunteer: San Diego Humane Society, San Diego Zoo, and Labrador Retrievers & More
- Awards: Dean's list
- Fun facts: I speak 4 languages fluently; English, Tagalog, Japanese, Bisayan; and was born in a different country where English wasn't my first language. I've also traveled around the world (where I received most of my "non-traditional" education from) and went on 2 grueling deployments while serving in the military

If accepted to GS, I'm hoping to major in Biology so that I may be able to apply my degree, as well as my 6+ years experience in the military and Pilates industry, to go to PT school. 

Good luck to everyone!

Totally applying for the Fall. Attended a similar info session at my CC, apparently they take 2 or 3 students from my CC every year! I'm just hoping that having a 4.0 in the honors program for 42 credits is enough to offset my... less-than-stellar history before I took a semester off. Touring band + full time student = bad news bears for GPA...

Stats:

Age: 23
Applying early decision
Major: Financial Econ
Middlesex Community College GPA: 4.0 (w/ Honors)
Cumulative GPA: 3.2-ish >_<
Gap year: Americorps-City Year
EC: Phi Theta Kappa (board member), Manager Student Newspaper, College Assembly Student Rep., Taskforce for Academic Standards

I submitted my application by Jan. 15 and got an email confirming that I will receive a decision by Mar. 1. Here's a bit about me:

- International student; studied abroad at the age of 17
- Graduated from a CC in WA
- PTK member
- GPA: 3.7/4.0 (completed 98 credits)
- Duolingo: 78
- Did 2 internships in the field of Business (one for the state) in the second year of CC while attending college full-time
- Working full time for a year in the field of Finance (Optional Practical Training - allows international students to work legally in the US for a year)
- Plan to study Economics and Supply Chain Management at GS and come back to my home country afterwards in hopes to contribute to the economic growth of my homeland. 

Feeling a bit worried. Anyone cares to share about your stats?

Greetings,

I have considered applying to Columbia GS, but would like to ask other prospective and recently admitted students to chance me.

Raw Stats:

High School GPA: 3.5
Emmanuel College GPA: 3.5
North Georgia College GPA: 3.85
SAT: 1850

I am a 23 year old, nontraditional student. After graduating from high school, I enrolled into a private, Christian college. Unfortunately, Emmanuel seemed to be more interested with denominational indoctrination than education. I was very dissatisfied, but decided to finish the semester.

I spent the next 7 months being a caretaker for my ailing grandparents. During this period, I began to soul search and decided to enroll in a nearby state university. North Georgia College served my needs, in terms of costs and location, but did not provide the rigorous environment that I desired. Frustrated, I began to explore other opportunities, alternatives to higher education, that could offer me the intellectual stimulation that I craved. In 2009, I landed an internship with the International Centre for Reconstruction & Development. This was the opportunity that I had sought.

I have spent the last two years promoting the liberalization of Nigeria. In collaboration with the Save Nigeria Group and Green Invasion Campaign, the ICRD has focused on the critical issues like infrastructure development, sufficient energy supply, and lowering the infant mortality rate. Although I mainly worked from the Atlanta office, in April of 2010, I had the opportunity to work in Nigeria and took it. I labored overseas for six months and loved it. Upon my return, I needed a job with better pay and signed on at Northeast Georgia Health Systems, Inc. as a medical observer.

During free time, I am still actively working with contacts in Nigeria for the 2011 election, because my mentor and former employer is a candidate for the Vice Presidency.

In short, I am wanting to finish my undergraduate education and would like to study in a rigorous environment with extraordinary people. Columbia seems to be such a place. I would apply for RD fall '11. What chance do I stand? 




_____UNKNOWN______

I don't know about that, HelloJan. I can't speak to the numbers, but one of the guys I know who had to take University Studies is LIGHT YEARS beyond some of the people I've seen here--CC, GS, SEAS, BC--and there's no WAY the university went out on a limb bringing him in. This guy's resume is ridiculous and his academic abilities shame me. To be frank, GS should slap his picture on a poster and use him to sell the school.

I was fortunate: I did NOT have to take US. But I know at least four people who did and have heard hearsay that the GS admins wish they could make everyone in GS take it.

But since I'm back for a second, let's examine University Writing. It happens to be my pet peeve here. If you move to NYC and get housing (which requires taking at least 12 credit hours) and take a full load...at some point, one of those classes is going to make you write a paper. I know, shocking, right? Hell, maybe you'll even have to write three papers. Maybe a dozen papers, one due every week. My point is, you're going to have write papers and it's going to be assumed that you know how to write them.

What good is taking a class that is ostensibly about teaching you to write papers if you're already having to write them anyway? My instructor has already said: "no one will ever ask you to write a lens or a conversation essay," so why is it being taught in ANY of the colleges? You've got kids coming from schools like Exeter: you'd better believe they can write a paper. Suffice it to say that if you've got people in GS who have never written a paper, then perhaps they should spend some time in a CC where they won't be burning 50k a year on tuition, housing and Top Ramen to feed the GS machine.

In the case of Columbia GS, you should FORGET about the brand name at all. It'll impress your friends back in Dogdick, but against the kind of academic pedigree I described, it won't stand alone. You play your Columbia GS card wrong and try to pass yourself off as a CC grad and you will not only not open doors, you'll find doors being slammed in your face. People are prickly about that stuff: and rightfully so.

Networks? I won't even begin to address the idea of a meritocracy in NYC. Old money talks. Dynastic wealth talks. Your last name talks. Your school talks. Your society connections talk. Your GPA and your GS degree? Yeah, they talk. They just don't speak as loudly as the 22 year old whose Uncle is a VP at Chase and whose family owns a summer house next to the head of BofA in ACK.

You can do plenty if you hustle, sure. But that's who you're going to be up against. Explain that to your lenders when they want their $250,000 back.

And let's talk Greek networks for a minute. Unless you make a VERY firm connection in a VERY old frat, a Greek network is FAR too small to trump something like a school. If we had societies like at Yale, final clubs like at Hahvahd, or eating clubs like Princeton, that might be one thing, but the social structure here isn't built that way. There's ONE secret society (ok, one and a half) at Columbia and trust me, they're not letting just anyone in. Most people write them off, but that's the stuff that matters. We're cliquish.

Varsity athletics? Some of you may be former pro. athletes and therefore ineligible to participate in NCAA athletics. But beyond that, I'm assuming that most of you are older than the average college student. Can you keep up with a 20 year old runner/swimmer/rower? I'll grant that there are some military guys (and women--I'm not ignoring you ladies) who can probably smoke these kids, but they're the exception. Kind of closes that door unless you're a real trooper.

Look. Come here if you want. Columbia's great. The academics are excellent. Aside from the massive amount of debt I'm incurring and the fact that I'm going to have to find a way to prove that I'm actually BETTER than my highly-suspect GS degree, I'm happy here and there's no reason you won't be either.

Don't take my word for it. Ask some of these people. Ask the GS cheerleaders, the GS naysayers. Come here and look around. HANG OUT with people who ACTUALLY go here.

I'm happy to extend the same courtesies that were extended to me when I was applying. If you want to see the UWS through my eyes, shoot me a PM when you're gonna be in NYC and I'll be happy to take you around. I'll even introduce you to GSers who love GS and who argue with me about these points. It'll be far from an official tour, but I promise it'll be more fun.

Just know that GS isn't CC. It's not supposed to be. Don't get sucked into this place just because it'll say Columbia.

There's a hierarchy here and you'd better believe that GS is at the bottom of it. 




_____UNKNOWN______

Another current GS student here. FYI: I am a peer and classmate of BoolaBoola's so I can vouch for BB's upstanding character and sincerity. I don't know if I've met Hellojan in real life on campus, but his/her record on this very board speaks for itself. This is a thread of knowledgeable folks offering real opinions, to which I will now submit my own.

1st thing: University Studies. Boola brought it up and I shall tear it down and put it to rest. You should not concern yourselves with it at this point except to know that it exists and it is offensive. It is, ostensibly, a semester-long, no-credit, free, yet required for some, course of lectures on subjects such as "time management," "exam preparation," and "managing your digital life." Who is selected upon admission for this requirement and who is not remains a small mystery. But this semester's class is large . . . 50-60 people? That's out of a Spring semester admitted class of 110-120 people. Administration claims it ranges from community college transfers (but not all of them) to first-time college students, to students who have had prior academic difficulty, to students away from school for extended periods. I am none of these. I'm a 4-year school transfer w/ a 3.65 GPA. I did, however, withdraw my last semester at my prior school and thus have a semester of "W"s on my transcript. This appears to be my ticket to University Studies. It's useless. It's uninformative. It's an insult to the intelligence of anyone involved. End of story. Grin and bear it.

Much of what I would share with you is similar to what Boola has already said. But I would also urge you to note that I, like Boola, am still here and will stay here, despite any criticisms I might have. I came here to study in a specific department, to enrich my development as a scholar, and get into a top PhD program. Despite the frightening financial picture, academics trump all for me, at this point.

But GS is a separate school. This is fact. There are financial, social, cultural, and psychological ramifications to this that cannot be changed. They may be minor, but they're real. My advice to you is what I wish I had done, and that's be sure to consider other options (if you haven't already). I wish I had seen it through and applied to Yale's EWSP, as well as for transfer admission to UC Berkeley, peer/nearly-peer institutions with better financial aid outlooks and similarly strong academics.

As for admissions, GS doesn't publish this data so I don't know how some websites can claim to know that it is 28%, or 36%, or whatever number is proposed. My impression is that those numbers seem a bit low. We have some of the brightest bulbs, for sure, but some pretty dim ones too. For any of you with experience in university-level writing and reading of criticism, these are the bulbs who will darken the days of your University Writing class. Trudge through it. Twice a week I go directly from University Writing to an upper-division English seminar and my day is inevitable brightened. In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen, indeed.

Best of luck to all.

Hello everyone!

I am applying RD, since I won't be able to make the March 1st deadline :-(
A little background info about myself: I first went to college in 2001, but had to leave in 2002. (Life happened, hard). After that, I worked in the hospitality and nightlife industry until 2009. In 2011, I graduated from a one year ultrasound program, where my gpa was a 2.76. I did excellent during my clinicals, though. I am presently in a CC in NY and have been attending part time since 2008. My gpa as of now is 3.35 and I have two Ws on my transcript (life happened again). I also volunteer at a major hospital in the city. I know my numbers are nothing to write home about, but I will still give GS a shot! (Yes, I know how incredibly competitive GS is). I know I'm smart, but also have been incredibly lazy and unmotivated. I am finally going to pursue a bachelor's degree, and nothing (or no one) is going to stop me this time around.


I am currently working on my autobiographical essay now, and am having a bit of a hard time. Writing about oneself is always the hardest thing to do, no??? It sure feels that way!

Anyways, good luck to everyone here!!! I can't wait to hear about everyone's journey :-)

P.S. As far as my SAT scores go, they expired. SAT scores expire after 8 years of taking them. So, I will have to take the "entrance" exam that GS offers. Since I graduated HS in 2001 (I'm 28 btw), I doubt GS will put THAT much importance on my grades. (I was an A-/B+ student). 




_____UNKNOWN______

Corrections:

North Georgia College GPA: 3.9
Overall GPA: 3.85

I realize that my stats are a bit low and have considered retaking the SAT. I didn't use wisdom when I last took it, walked in after working a hellish, 12-hour shift in ICU.

And the issue of costs doesn't concern me as much as the quality of education. While in college, most of the texts I read were written by Columbia professors like Joseph Stiglitz or Jeffrey Sachs. The questions they raised and theories they proposed have been critical in the work I've done in Nigeria. Also, Columbia has unparalleled opportunities, like the Earth Institute, to gain more knowledge and experience to help with Third World development.

I was accepted yesterday. I applied on the June 1st deadline and one of my recs came in on June 21st.

I've also traveled around the world (where I received most of my "non-traditional" education from) and went on 2 grueling deployments while serving in the military

If accepted to GS, I'm hoping to major in Biology so that I may be able to apply my degree, as well as my 6+ years experience in the military and Pilates/yoga industry, to go to PT school. 

Good luck to everyone and feel free to let me know what you think!

 Hello everyone,

Submitted my app for early decision a while ago, still waiting for one transcript to process. I'm a Marine combat vet (former scout-sniper team leader, multiple combat tours), attended a community college, and I'm now at the University of Michigan in Dearborn. Had a rough time adjusting to the civilian world; I kind of came under some wanderlust after a rough breakup, climbed mountains, and neglected my studies. My GPA from the community college is only a 3.6, but if you exclude a nine credit hour class which I received a C in during my quest to find answers in solitude on the tops of mountains, then I have a 3.9 (40-some credit hours). I'm doing well at Michigan, just finished an eight week accelerated course which I earned an A in, so my Michigan transcript has me down for a 4.0 with three credit hours (hey, I'll take it) and 11 more which I'm in the process of completing.

I drove to NYC a couple weekends back and took the GSAE, felt pretty good about it. Right now I live in an apartment by myself, work at a lumber yard in Detroit, and go to school full-time. I'm looking at GS's Middle Eastern Studies program or Poli Sci with an emphasis on IR. If I don't get in this time around then I'll to take a Spring semester at U of M - D and give GS another shot. I really wish you all the best of luck.

Thanks,
Mike

(By the way, that nine credit hour class was an emergency medical technician course; like I said, I had a rough time and made some knee-jerk, scatterbrained decisions. Best of luck to you all.)

Hey all,

Just got accepted today! I had applied before the Jan. 15th deadline but my admissions decision was delayed a week for a certain reason. I wanted to share my stats and story because everyone who had posted theirs before me had helped me gain a better understanding of how the process works and who has a chance at getting in. It would only be fair to give back to this community.


My Story:

Attended a 4 yr public state university after high school and did really, really bad. .27 Cumulative GPA over 2 semester's.

Left school for a few years and then attempted to get back on track at a community college. Once again, did very poorly so I stopped attending altogether (1 C and a few F's and W's). Then a few things happened in my life that forced me to reassess who I was and where I wanted to go in life. Returned to the same community college and performed very well. 1 C the first semester back (Drawing), 1 B, and then 16 A's in a row. However, last summer, I had a personal issue come up which caused me to finish a stats course with a D. I am currently taking the same stats course now and am expecting to finish with an A.

Stats:
.27 GPA, 19 Credits (1st school, 4 yr)
3.74 GPA, 58 Credits (community college, brought down by 2 C's as explained in my story and 1 
Major: Philosophy
Essay: Wrote strongly about how philosophy changed my life and renewed my love for learning

Good luck to everyone in the future!

SAT 1660/2400 (My high school score 7 years ago. I heard a rumor that the average range is 2100+, and I can score 1950+ on practice tests, but a recruiter insisted it was just a checkmark to see if you can read English. Challenge accepted.)
Essays: They must have been good. I gave each my best effort. I only worked on them for a few days though.
Recommendations: Great. My boss wrote my first letter. I didn't know it at the time, but he taught at Columbia for 10 years. My economics club advisor wrote my second.
Extra-Curriculars:
-Air Force Veteran
(I think this is the big one as GS was primarily founded to educate returning servicemen from World War II. The veteran community is overwhelmingly supportive.)
-Economics & Finance Club—Treasurer -(GS seems to like this activity. Three of my friends got in.)
-College National Fed Challenge-BMCC Representative
-National Anthem & Alma Mater Performer: BMCC 50th Commencement at Madison Square Garden
-Official United States National Anthem and Italian National Anthem Performer for Aviano Air Base, Italy, 2013.
-BMCC Art & Music Department-Clerical Assistant
-Various stage manager volunteer work at community theaters and Air Force "Tops in Blue" performances.

To be honest I wasn't that interested in the school, and I even talked about that in my essay. At my school, a lot of students want in for the 'brand.' Even my professors pressured me to apply because it was prestigious. I really just want to study the economics of the art, entertainment, and cultural heritage industries; I already possess a lot of books on the subject. In my essays, I talked about how I need exposure to aesthetics and the axiology of art—emphasizing how this program could help me. I helped my friend who got into the Financial Economics program with her essays last year. I believe that if you are genuine, reveal your weaknesses, and explain how different events have shaped you as a person, you are a strong candidate.

@CUSOGS
RD. I was notified on December 10th. I didn't submit the second part of the application until November 28th. I told you I was surprised.

I have also been lurking in this forum since I submitted my app in January. I got accepted (yay!!), so for those of you who are interested in my stats/story:

I'm 24. I am originally from Mexico City, I dropped out of high school (went only for a year) because it seemed like a waste of money and time; I was NOT into formal education. I also dropped out because I wanted to pursue my passion (film/photography) and so I went to photography school for three years.

I moved here a little over 4 years ago with no high school diploma. I was severely depressed for two years and so I did nothing during that period of time except for two continuing ed courses in photography (took them at SVA).

After two years, I finally decided to get my life together and I enrolled at a summer-long course that was designed to prepare students for the TASC (formerly known as GED) exam. After a month, I was told I was ready to take it; I passed and a week after, I was already in the admissions office of my community college. Funny thing is that I just wanted to have a high school diploma and my plans never included going to college.

So then I went to community college and I excelled during my first semester, which was surprising due to the fact that I had been out of school for over 5 years at that point. As of now, I have completed 51 college credits, my GPA is 3.97, and I will be graduating in May.

I have taken approx. 19 honors credits, I'm a PTK member and executive board member of the Honors Association. I've been part of several other EC activities, including being editor-in-chief of two newsletters (one for the Honors Association and the other for the feminist club on campus) and presenting a paper at the Beacon Conference. Relevant employment includes working as a writing, cinema studies (my major) and mathematics tutor in my school's tutoring center for over 2 years now.

In my essay, I talked about all those things, why I chose to study film, and how regardless of my disdain for formal education during those years, I've always sought knowledge independently. Honestly, my essay wasn't anything extraordinary, I just talked about my life story.

Oh, I also had to take the TOEFL iBT (scored 113) because I didn't attend secondary school here.

My top advise for prospective students is: be authentic in your essay and don't forget to mention what you think you can bring to CU. :-)

For those who have already been admitted, have you guys been able to log into the financial aid portal?

Thanks BB!!! You can imagine how thrilled I am. I can't remember having ever received a more wonderful phone call than the one I received today. (Even though my cell dropped the call mid-way through and ended up forcing the admissions person to voice mail -- faux pas!)

Stats:

Prospective Major at CU: Comparative Lit. & Society

College 1 (after high school gap year):
Highly-selective art school
GPA: 3.6 (3 semesters)

College 2:
Humanities program at different art school
GPA: 3.5 (2 semesters)

College 3:
Public 4-year university
GPA: 4.0 (1 semester)

(cumulative GPA: 3.6)

Work Experience/Info:

At my first school I had an internship on the design and research committee for a massive exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, (the only undergrad to get one).

After taking time off from my first school to work, I launched a small business (a design firm) 50/50 with my business partner which has become a not-as-small business. We've been increasingly successful over the past few years, we have a few employees and a couple big clients and recently relocated the company from San Francisco to NYC. And it all started as what was going to be temporary work while I transitioned from an art school/art theory background into Humanities/literary theory study. But it took off. Anyway...

Being a business owner has been an incredible adventure but alas, I've always been an academic at heart and am long overdue to return to a more intellectual world.

Freckleback-I feel it's pretty decent. My stats-Phi Thetha Kappa, GPA 3.65, Volunteer+Team Leader for New York Cares. My essay was pretty good, I put in a lot of effort into it. My high school credentials are a bit off, mostly B's, C's and D's. I did high school oversea's so I'm assuming my high school gpa would be around 2.6-3.0, not sure. Aaagh I did notice a minor typo on my application though:/-stress of midterms and submitting the application on time.

I received an email yesterday (4/30) stating there was an update regarding the status of my application and I was accepted.

I'll post stats, just because that seems to be a common question. And because seeing stats helped me gauge my chances and helped me ease my mind.

Mind you, I'm not the most stacked individual. And to those who are not so stacked, I hope this provides some comfort, relief, and possibility.

I also applied at 11:59pm on March 1st. Columbia received my transcripts from Uni around March 20th.


Congratulations to all the people who got in already. And to those waiting, stay positive!

Good fortune to all!!

Hi there! I got the e-mail last night that I was accepted, and I couldn't be happier.
I am a 24-year-old woman from Denmark. Our school system is a bit different so I don't have an actual GPA. I took the toefl test this December and since high school I have been working with different things, traveling and volunteering with AFS, which is a program for exchange students around the world. I was an exchange student in Minnesota in 2007 where I had a very high GPA and was an honor student. I am really surprised that I got in, but I think it was a combination of my recommendations, my essay and my overall life experience, since my grades from Denmark wasn't the best. I have taken some college/high school courses to improve my grades since I graduated in 2011 and I finished a private school course in Singing this winter.

My major is gonna be Political Science and I hope to one day work at the UN to end human trafficking. This I wrote about in the optional essay.
I, as well as BROntasaurus, completed my application just a few minutes before deadline and all my transcripts were in by the 20th of March.
I was sure that my grades weren't good enough.

I received a phone call, private number at around 9:30 in the morning (of course I missed it); the woman left a message and I called her right back. She informed me that Fed Ex would be sending my packet but that she just wanted to let me know that I've been accepted. I did apply as a transfer. She said that my admissions exam scores were competitive, with a strong score in technical writing; she mentioned that my autobiographical essay was wonderful to read and that they were impressed with my ability to balance academics and family life. I have kids whom I've homeschooled and was 9 months pregnant while sitting for the exam; I also maintained a 4.0 while taking a full schedule of 5 classes, most of which were honors courses while being pregnant and giving birth. My cumulative GPA is a 3.9 because I had received 2 B's back in 1997- but has been a 4.0 for the last two years in the honors program at a community college. I have no extracurricular activities to speak of. I might add that none of the pregnancy stuff or being a mom was in my essay--> where did they get that info- I have no idea (facebook? or one of my recommendation letters?)

I wish everyone the BEST of luck- it is indeed a torturous wait- but so worth it! The admissions woman was so welcoming and warm-- it gave me a good feeling about attending. Definitely excited! 




_____UNKNOWN______

My stats:

-Seeking 2nd bachelor’s degree
-First bachelor’s was in Religious Studies at a little-known college. Went back to school last year to study Comp Sci & Physics at my community college. It’s not easy to get into a good graduate program without an undergraduate degree in these fields, so a second B.A. made sense.
-First bachelor GPA: 3.96, Outstanding Achievement Award
-My return to school 2016-17: 4.0 GPA, 30 credits
-High school performance was garbage, but that was a long time ago so whatever…I talked about it in my essay
-SAT: 1510 (740 R&W, 770 M; 99th percentile)
-Attended Stanford Summer Session this past summer, earned 9 credits
-Extra-curricular Silicon Valley Innovation Academy (SVIA) at Stanford University…which I did in service of my interest in Computer Science/Technology
-Excellent, 2-3 page letter of recommendation from Stanford professor
-Other recommendation from community college professor…didn’t get to read it, but from what he told me it sounded decent
-Essays: I did both the regular essay and the optional. In retrospect my essay could have been better. I tried to tell a narrative of my initial interest in spirituality, leading to me earning a degree in Religious Studies, and my subsequent transition to technology and science. Some parts I think were good, other parts I think I got bogged down in the details and it may come off as dry or boring. I’m slightly worried about that.

Anyway, we’ll see what happens! Maybe Monday’s the day, but I have a gut feeling they’re gonna push this all the way til the 15th. 




_____UNKNOWN______

BoolaBoola, yeah, I'd say you can expect a call Monday or Tuesday. No reason for Admissions to be speaking with FinAid unless you got in.

My stats:

Prospective major at CU: Philosophy with a concentration in political science.

College GPA: 4.0 (34 credits / 2 full-term semesters, 1 summer session)

Work:
U.S. Marine Corps, Combat Correspondent (4 years, 8 months.)

ECs:
College Philosophy Forum, President
College Newspaper, copy editor

Volunteering:
Upward Bound House homeless shelter, food service (2010)
Brevard County Public High Schools, teaching assistant (2008)
Department of Defense Education Activity, teaching assistant (2006)

Letters of Recommendation:
I had two outstanding, somewhat personal letters of recommendation from professors with whom I took two or three classes with, which described me as among the very best students they had and used anecdotal and statistical information evidencing such.

Essay:
I considered this the strongest part of my application. If anyone wants to read my essay, PM me and I'd be glad to show you. It's chronological, but I think I made it work; I also have the peculiar advantage of having had a very atypical life.

Personality/Autobiographical information:
I was born into a working poor environment, an only child with a single mother who dropped out of school in the seventh grade, who worked many jobs and typically earned about $14,000 per year. I was very anti-establishment in my teenage years, and I felt that the educational system in neighborhoods like mine was a farce perpetuated by the convenience of the ghetto endemic. After 9/11, I decided to join the Marine Corps as a journalist because in spite of my anger towards the government, the idea of a group of men and women who believed in something enough to sign their lives to it was a novel concept to a boy surrounded by slum apathy. I was sent primarily to humanitarian assistance/disaster relief projects during my time in, detailing our efforts bringing aid to the third world. I had a great awakening during this time, realizing the parallels and contrasts between the poverty of my youth and in these nations. Going back to school on the GI Bill, I fell in love with books and became intensely interested in educational politics, because I felt that education was the key missing factor from each of these areas where the poor were so politically insecure and disaffected. I intend to work in educational politics and detailed in my essay why I felt Columbia's pragmatic approach to political philosophy and dedication to its non-traditional program were perfect for the cultivation of my want for radical approach to educational policy.

I also want to post my stats for anyone who needs a little hope. Like sha, I stalked threads like this for the last year and seeing the stats of others was so helpful. Plus, I am not a vet, or a ballerina, or an ex-CEO. I'm just a regular girl whose dream is to go to Columbia University and change the world (no biggie lol).

Age: 25
GED (Obtained last year. 10 years after dropping out of 9th grade)
SAT Score (earlier this year) - 1840
First gen college student
3 Semesters @ Community College
GPA: 3.89
President of 2 clubs (including PTK); Student body rep on school committee; Coauthored scientific paper; Coordinated several campus events; Speaking engagements; etc.

My essay was about my tumultuous childhood, how I ended up leaving school so early, created a career for myself after 10 years of hard work, then decided to change the trajectory of my life by quitting my high-paying job to pursue an M.D. and inspire people with similar stories to mine. In the end, of course, I talked about why Columbia is the most fitting option for the next step on my journey.

Can't wait to meet all the new students in January! xoxo

Hi everyone,

In response to your questions @DualDegreeSeeker @vossari , please see below:

1. If you attend 24 hours of classes per week, this is about 5 hours per day. How do you then have time to study, read the material, write papers, join some extracurricular clubs, etc... ?

Sciences Po teaches students about time management and being strategic in your work. Despite the heavy workload, we manage to balance our school time with extracurriculars and other interests. Also, there is less outside work compared to Columbia, where you might really need a lot of time in the library, for example. At Sciences Po, students prepare oral presentations as the primary form of assessment.

2. Do you have classes every day of the week? How about on Saturday?
If the grading is so harsh, how is credit earned for Columbia? Would a 13 be put as an A on Columbia's transcript or as a 65/100? How would that affect graduating with honors or graduate degree applications?

Generally, students have class every day of the week up until Thursday. Most do not have Friday classes, but there are some courses only offered on Fridays. There is no class on Saturday. To get credit for Sciences Po courses at Columbia, students need to achieve at least an 11. The Columbia GPA is only a sum of the grades received while at Columbia - therefore Sciences Po grades are not factored in. Alumni from the program have graduated with honors, and have been inducted into groups that recognize academic excellence such as the GS Honor Society and Phi Beta Kappa. For an official grade conversion scale, check out the Fulbright's evaluation: http://www.fulbright-france.org/docs/2010163656_NoticeN3.pdf

3. Do you cook your own meals or is there some sort of a meal plan or cafeteria? If you cook your meals, how do you have time if you take that many classes?

Most students cook their own meals while at Sciences Po. The Reims campus now has a cafe that serves light refreshments like sandwiches and pastries. During the day, there are also several bakeries around campus that sell sandwiches, quiches, and other lunch foods. There is no meal plan like at a traditional 4-year American college however. Generally, students live close to campus and it is easy to go home for lunch. Otherwise, students will grab something near campus, or bring their own food for lunch.

4. How are the integration efforts by Columbia for years 3 and 4 students? By then most Columbia students have already forged their friendships and I am afraid it will be hard to widen your circle of friends outside of the dual degree proram and become a "normal" Columbia student. Is it hard to join clubs especially when other students are on their 3rd year in a particular club. Do they look at you as an outsider?

I think the Dual BA makes you a Columbia student - that is part of your Columbia story and experience. Especially being at GS, where students have a varied background of experiences - from serving in the military, to being professional actors and dancers, athletes, being student parents, being dual degree students, etc - you find a place where you belong. The GS community has been incredibly welcoming and open in my experience, especially since it is smaller than the other schools. Dual BA students also easily make friends with students from Columbia College and Barnard because we are the same age. By joining clubs and extra-curriculars, even making friends in class, you'll find a community of friends from the other schools. In my experience though, GS is truly suited for Dual BA students because our advisors work primarily with dual degree students throughout GS, and know how to support our needs and goals. The advisors visit the students in France at least twice a year to plan out their time at Columbia, and are always available via Skype and e-mail.

5. Do you have access to all what Columbia offers like any Columbia College student? Is The School of General Studies held to the same esteem as Columbia College? Do students mingle and look at each other as equal?

^Similar to above answer. All students have access to the same courses, libraries, career services, etc and graduate with the same degree. Each school has its own student council that will plan events or opportunities particular to its own school.

6. Do you have access to any course you wish to take as any other student?

Yes, we can take classes at Columbia and Barnard, and even in the graduate schools with certain instructor permission.

7. How do employers look at dual degree graduates? Do they consider it similar to a regular Columbia (or other same caliber colleges) double major grads? In other words does the dual degree give you an edge or not especially that it is granted by GS?

In my experience, the Dual BA Program has made me stand out as a candidate because there is a rich story behind it. Undergraduate dual degree programs are rare- especially between two prestigious schools, across two continents - and it is a very interesting talking point to employers. It reflects the student's ability to adapt and the desire to challenge themselves. There is no distinction between degrees that GS and CC students receive - on a resume, both will say "Columbia University", and won't specify the school. For those interested in international careers, the Dual BA is very well suited and respected.

Hope these answers are helpful - please let me know if you have any follow-up questions!

Laetitia

I failed out of a four-year school. I got a job working for the state in maintenance; I realized I didn't want to be doing that type of work forever. So I went back to school. (there was no year + gap, so giving hope to anyone in the same situation as me) I worked full-time and went to school full-time. Eventually my CFO noticed my hard work and offered me a job working in finance.

One thing I really focused on was how it took me until after I failed out to realize the value of education.

Tip for those applying after me: I think they want you to focus on how you came to value education. Many stories on their website and mail involve people explaining how they came to value education. But that's just an observation of mine and I could be way off base.

About red x's: I didn't see any until after I was accepted. They make you upload satisfactory spring grades.

Edit: About interviews: I didn't get an interview but I did get an email this week asking for some clarification about some things in my application.

Also didn't get a phone call telling me I was accepted.

@03obvious Good to see a fellow North Carolinian accepted.

Hi,
I am applying to Columbia GS now by the June 1st deadline and wondering what my chances are. I am 20 years old and have taken 3 years off after high school. Ive been in a wheelchair for 12 years and replaced both hips and knees and been recovering getting back to walking and I'm now ready to start college. I'm worried my SAT score is not strong enough and wonder if I can get some feedback. I also wonder if the admission office has a holistic view on applicants, I know my SAT scores aren't the best but I have a lot of motivation and passion to go to college and study. I was accepted to Pepperdine but I really want to be on the east coast and Columbia is my #1 choice. I will be so appreciative of any advice. Thanks!

Stats
-Highschool GPA: 3.96
-SAT: 1100
-Competed for several science clubs for my school
-Had my own small business in High School

Hello everyone. I made an account just to say I got accepted and hopefully connect with some of you starting with me in the fall! I originally got accepted for spring 2019 but I needed to defer and I just found out a few days ago that I was accepted again for Fall.

Hi everyone! I'm surprised this thread isn't more active; I'm just popping in to share my stats and wish good luck to everyone else who applied Early Action! Here's hoping we all get accepted!

Again, good luck to everyone and I can't wait to find out the admissions decisions in a couple of months!

JamesInGlendale--

I'd send you my essay if it weren't so personal. I think that, at least as far as G/S goes, many applicants are going to be hesitant in showing anyone outside of admissions their essay simply because they often touch on personal experiences that aren't really meant for other people to probe, especially in the context of examining a successful essay. Other people might be more than willing to--I certainly can't speak for anyone but myself--but this is sort of the feeling I get.

That said, I definitely think you fit the profile--if it can be said that such a profile exists--of a non-traditional student. Your professional achievements are certainly noteworthy.

Academically, you're in a bit of a tough spot. The D's and F's will raise some questions especially since it seems that they weren't that long ago. How did that affect your overall GPA? They're going to look at that as well as your courses and your SAT/ACT scores if you have taken them.

I wish you the best of luck!

@juliaxa Congratulations!!! And I'm happy to help - looking forward to meeting you too 

@xoxoPaulina Some of us were surprised to learn our program even has a waitlist; I guess it's because the program is getting more and more applicants but staying the same size. I would do as @DualDegreeSeeker suggested. Email them reiterating your interest in the program - tell them it's your dream choice and that you will go if you are accepted off the waitlist (assuming that's true). But depending on the campus, there MAY be a fair chance they will take a couple waitlist people, as I know there will probably be a couple people who don't choose the program for financial or other reasons.

And FYI I'm pretty sure most of us felt as if our interviews were really bad, haha - that's mostly because of the poker face and the grilling the Sciences Po interviewer gives you. I thought I totally blew my chances at getting into the program after my interview.

@reims17 To add on to some of what @vossari said:
5. Apparently Columbia is pretty generous with the grade conversion from Sciences Po, which gives us a nice advantage in terms of GPA when we arrive at Columbia. Actually the valedictorian of the School of General Studies last year was a Dual BA student. And Patrick Martinez said the Dual BA students have the highest GPA out of all of the students at Columbia (I guess average GPA of Dual BA students compared to students at other schools?).
6. Yeah, you don't have to take any classes in French (except the required French class if you aren't fluent). BUT you certainly can take classes in French if you're so inclined! At least in Le Havre, if you are B2 French or higher, you have to take your elective in French OR a second language from the region of focus (so Asian language for us). If your French is A1 to B1, you don't have to take a French elective (and you probably should not, as it will be very difficult for you) or a second language unless you want to.

@ junho8611

I'll be entering as a freshman with no college credit, but my high school stats are the following:
-3.8 GPA unweighted, no class ranking
-1320/1600 SAT, 30 ACT, SAT II 730 Chem, 650 Bio, 650 World History
-Some random awards and extracurriculars

After high school I worked for a few months then I joined the Air Force and have been in just over 3 years now. I am currently a crew chief and maintain F-15 aircraft. My story is not super exciting haha, but I sure am looking forward to getting out and going back to school! 




_____REJECTED______

@Kd6410 @en2900 -- thank you for your posts. I'm honestly so glad that I'm not alone in the way I feel about my rejection. I became so attached to the program that I habitually went on forums/websites to "shorten" the wait before interview decisions. Now, it just feels awkward with reality hitting hard and stopping me from doing such things.

I guess the admissions committee did have viable reason (I actually wish that it's possible to ask them what the specific causes were that led to the rejection). Also, what makes this all the more easier to digest is that both of you, based on your posts in this forum, seem like good, interested candidates for the program who do better in holistic admissions like me (i.e. relatively low GPAs/scores but great essays, extracurriculars, and recs.) It helps me know that I wasn't an outlier in the type of people being rejected.

Perhaps -- again perhaps -- it is possible to appeal the rejection if the program allows it. I know that it is an extremely rare thing to do (only if there is some significant improvement in your application), but it may be better to do something than nothing.

Hi everyone, I just got accepted into Columbia University GS.
About me:
male, 23 yrs. foreign student, GPA 4.0, and Student body President of my community college.
I also got into UC Berkeley, School of business, which offered me full ride.
However, Columbia has not told me how much scholarship I am going to get.

I have 2 questions:
First, has anyone heard anything about their scholarship?
Second, which university would you guys go if you were in my place? Berkeley or Columbia? my major is Finance and business Administration.

@yesorno0101 I don't want to get too specific but I'll share a bit. I was very immature in high school, had a gpa around 3.0-3.1. High ACT- 33-35 range. Went to a local state school, was still horribly immature, didn't cut it, low 2s-high 1s GPA. Took a year off and turned my life around in a number of ways. I moved to a big city and enrolled in a local school where I have a 4.0 over 25 credits. My recommendations were very good I believe (I didnt see them), from teachers that saw how hard I worked, and I'm sure spoke about how I had knowledge, commitment, curiosity, and questions that went far beyond and above the scope of the classes. I wrote a very personal essay, one that really went deep into who I was, why I performed the way I did, and why I really changed. Spoke about what really interests me, my love of what I'm going to study, and how all my interests really tie together, and why the liberal arts curriculum and city would be perfect for me. I felt quite strongly about all of it. 




_____UNKNOWN______

Hi all!

I also found out on the 17th -- I was so shocked when I got my packet in the mail. I found out I got into UCLA as well today, but I already mailed in my tuition deposit for Columbia. I didn't need much time to think it over! I was not at all expecting to get into Columbia. I sort of applied just for the hell of it. This opportunity feels too good to be true, but I'll take it. 

My GPA at my current community college (representing three years of being a full time student, and almost 90 credits) is 3.87, but if you include other courses I took several years ago at other schools, that brings my GPA to about a 3.65. I guess they liked my essay -- I just wrote about why I was a nontraditional student and explained the circumstances of my family life, which forced me to drop out of high school and return to community college several years later. I also talked a bit about why Columbia would be the best for my major (Art History). Because I never took the SATs, I took their GS exam in the fall.

I am nervous about moving and leaving my life in LA and my amazing friends, but this feels like too good a chance to miss. For a high school dropout, Columbia ain't shabby...

Applied only to two schools for transfer and I was also accepted to NYU Gallatin; turned it down because--duh--this is COLUMBIA. I might have chosen NYU had Columbia taken far fewer credits, but they took about the same amount and that made the decision easy.

I think I got in because of my essay which was really strong, my interview, and the fact that I kept in touch with them and let them know what I was up to (between the time I submitted my app and the time I was notified of admissions decision).

Hey guys! I'm sorry that so many of you were rejected today.

I actually got accepted today, and I'm super excited/happy! Also, they didn't send me an e-mail. I just noticed on my Albert that there was a link to an Admissions Offer in the Application Status page, so for those still waiting, be sure to check there and see if you were accepted!

Yesterday my financial aid page changed to "2016: Award Access Not Available" and yesterday the Student tab appeared for the first time to me as well. Also, this morning, my transfer credit report was available on Albert. I don't know if any of these are indicators of acceptance, so take these changes with a grain of salt.

For those wondering, these are my stats:

3.78 GPA in an engineering program at an international university
4.00 GPA in secondary school
Ranked 1 in secondary school
40/45 in the IB Diploma Program

I was accepted by CAS for the Math BA.

Anyway, good luck to those still waiting and again, sorry for the ones who weren't admitted. Hopefully things will work out for you guys!

Hi guys, I have been stalking this site for months and was on last night trying to figure out if I will be getting accepted or not. I actually flew across the country on Wednesday and visited the school yesterday in hopes that it would bring me some good luck... and it did! I got my acceptance email tonight! I have to defer until fall (prego with an already amazing little boy) but I'm glad I know I can set up a residence here and start looking for an apartment.

Here are my stats:
- I applied on the Nov. 5 deadline.
- 27 years old as of this week.
- Terrible HS grades, 2.5 I believe. Explained those in the essay, due to absolutely horrible home situation.
- 4 years in the Marine Corps.
- Currently a firefighter (5 years) with a 72 hour a week schedule.
- I volunteer with 2 children's charities.
- I am a volunteer crisis counselor for people who witness traumatizing events.
- I have a heroism award from my county.
- I am the Department of Defense Hero of the Year.
- I have about 31 credits with a 3.4 GPA, and explained the low GPA in my additional essay as being due to lack of study time with work and charity and also a major accident I was involved it.

I honestly believe my essay is what got me in since my grades aren't remarkable at all. I also attended two admissions events last month and kept in contact with the representative. That helped! Keep bugging them so they remember you!

I look forward to meeting all of you soon! 




_____UNKNOWN______

I will be deferring until Fall (baby due in January) and I am currently in Seattle, WA.

Congratulations to those who made it and good luck to those still waiting to hear!

Hi guys, I am kind of late to this discussion, but I also applied to GS for fall 2019.
Among the requirements, I submitted everything online and took the online GS English placement test on the 02/28 since I do not have any sat score to report.
I wonder when I should be getting the result since I have seen many of them who applied for early decision already got the decision letter.
In addition, here are my stats. If you could chance me that would be great. Thank you!

From a ccc
Major: Computer Science
GPA: Overall gpa: 3.79

//I did academic renewal for Philosophy class, one W from Sociology class,
//One repeated course which was the first C++ class. Grade changed from F to A.

EC: Discharged veteran(Army), Math tutor, Member of non-profit organization for veterans, two certificates from Microsoft, Dean's honor list, some awards from the Army.

Antika - Why wouldn't we be able to? We're not the bastardized, red-headed, step-children of CU, despite what some say. GS has the highest accumulative GPA of the three schools at CU. We have the same campus, faculty, degree, everything. The only differences, as one who applied and was accepted should know, are that we have a different administration and different admissions requirements because we're for non-traditional students. As your title says, it's Columbia University Club, not Columbia College, indicative that any of the subordinate schools are welcome.

Additionally, you just got accepted to an Ivy League school. You should be aware of the hard work involved. As such, why not try a little research? I typed in 'Columbia University Club' in google and it was the first link. Underneath that, was the 'Eligiblity' link.

Columbia University Club of New York: Home Page

Also, I guess I'll write my stats as well.

Marine veteran- Avionics Technician/ Process Improvement Consultant
3.9 GPA from a CCC- No honors
EC's: Solo backpacking through Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.
SAT: Awful high school scores
HS GPA: 2.5

I had a letter of recommendation from my OIC and from a professor. My essays tied together my Honduran immigrant background, my experience in the Marines, and my foreign travels. 




_____ACCEPTED______

I just got accepted!! It was posted on the 24th. I can’t believe it. I’m an international student so I’m nor sure what my GPA would be. These are my stats:

- 24, nontraditional student
- HS GPA: roughly translates to a 3.8
- international flight attendant for an european airline
- former computer game tester
- went to business school for one year (had very average grades in Business subjects but a 4.0 in my minor which I now want to pursue as a major and I made sure to justify both of that greatly)
- left school to work in different startups
- since then working in different big tech companies
- good EC’s: Rotary, started a project for refugees in my city, in general social services...
- I guess my recommendations were good, one was from a former teacher that knows me well and another one from a manager
- As a standardized test score I only had to submit the TOEFL score which was 117.

Good luck to everyone! It‘s 6AM in Germany so I feel like I‘m still in a dream  




_____ACCEPTED______

I found the posts from past applicants throughout the years to be useful and informative so I've made an account myself to contribute. Hopefully this is helpful to any future applicants in some small way.

Application submitted on the early decision deadline of 3/1/19
Letters of recommendation submitted separately by both my references on 3/20/19
Notified of acceptance via email on 4/24/19 (email stated there was an update to my application status on the admissions portal; upon logging into the admissions portal there was a new link which led to the acceptance letter)

My background/stats:

26 y/o male
US Army Veteran - Green Beret/JTAC (2012-2019)
High School GPA - 2.82
Rutgers GPA - 2.1 (2010-2012)
Community College GPA - 4.0 (2015-2016; took a few online classes while in the military)
SAT: 1930 (taken 11 years ago in 2008 while I was attending high school)

Some things to note:
- I attended a GS tour and admissions information session. The information session was extremely worthwhile. The tour was well conducted, but was of little use to me personally.
- After speaking with an admissions manager during said information session, it was abundantly clear to me that test scores matter little in comparison to the essay, LOR's, and what you bring to the table as a non-traditional student; thus, I did not elect to take the GSAE or retake any standardized tests despite my SAT score being over a decade old.
- I submitted a resume even though it was optional. My resume was pretty much a more easily-digestible version of my DD214 and military service history.
- I did not have any extracurricular activities or community service listed on my application.
- I did not use service-to-school or any such similar program, though I do hear that they are indeed awesome and quite a valuable resource.

I believe having solid LOR's and furnishing a well written essay that communicates what drives you as a person, what fuels your passions, and your story/unique experiences that have brought you to this point in your life are monumental towards getting accepted. I have no doubt that those two components of my application are by far what carried me the most.

Good luck to those who are still waiting to hear back; looking forward to meeting everyone in the Fall! 




_____UNKNOWN______

That's good to hear.. Thank you!

Sure:
-25 y/o female
-White/Native American
-Currently a grant writer for a local animal welfare organization. Pretty competitive nonprofit resume.
-High school GPA: 4.05
-College GPA: 2.5
-Standardized scores were old/subpar so I took the GSAE
-Letters of recommendation from the Executive Director of my organization and the former Assistant Dean at St. John's College.

Brief background info (which I included in my essay) - childhood/adolescence was rocky as my home life was unstable (drugs, abuse, etc), and my family was very low income. I was offered full scholarship to a private high school, was homeless during my senior year, declared financial independence in early 2012, and attended St. John's College in Santa Fe for 2.5 years.

I used my essay primarily as a space to flesh out my history and the roadblocks I've overcome, with a tie-in to my professional trajectory. Definitely had a lot of explaining to do given my performance in college the first time around.

To be honest, I'm shocked to even be invited to interview - I'm sure my GSAE score is nightmarishly bad, because I didn't realize that the essay portion was timed and got maybe 100 of the required 600 words written before it autosubmitted.

@Dz11375‌ and to anyone else interested, here are my stats:
Graduated high school 2009, with 3.9 GPA, from an accredited U.S. distance education program. Like homeschooling but with tests, subjects and materials administered by a school. Im currently 23, female, and intl student
And the only other academic credentials or stats that i have apart from that is my SATs which i just took last year, with basically no studying or preparation ( i was initally being recruited as an athlete so i was told that with a certain score i would be ok for specific colleges) I got a 670 CR, 470 math which totally blows haha, and 620 writing. My SAT II were foreign language, 800 and Literature which I got a 660 or 670.

In terms of background, Im Persian and Urugayan and I have lived in several different countries: south america, europe, in the U.S., and close to africa on an island. (I know i just listed continents haha)
Im a semi-pro / pro tennis player (looking to start pro competition again this year) which is why i was homeschooled to begin with, and im also a certified tennis coach with 5-6 years work experience in prestigious/well known academies.
I started my own jewelry business which is not a biggie, but around 2 years ago I opened a bakery, which I currently still own and run, + is what I live off of. I also love to write so I self-published a poetry book so i could share my writing in readings, but i just got signed to a publishing company in my country and will be releasing some poetry soon. Nothing big, more an important personal accomplishment.

There are a few other things like law firm interships i have done through the years, and writing for local papers and so on. But of course as you can see, academically i dont have anything spectacular, which is why i really understand the admissions officer encouraging me to go to community college and reapply. I feel i probably had a strong background and story, (not all of it is included here) with lots of diversity for sure, but all i have to show school wise is a distance education program and relatively okay SAT scores.

I applied to Gettysburg and Sarah Lawrence too and i was waitlisted at both which was a nice surprise!!

Some really impressive people here!

Anyhow, here's my stats:

I'm coming from a California CC, transferring to SFS.
Units completed: 33 (will be 45 by the end of this semester)
GPA: 4.0
HS GPA: I don't remember. I graduated 10 years ago.
SAT: 2010
ACT: 30
EC: Student Veterans Organization (officer position), Persian club, and I play in a cello group.
Recs: I didn't see most of them, but one I received from an old boss was pretty embarrassing. I mean that in a good way, since it made me sound like a superhero.
Essays: I didn't think they were good, but the lady who helped me edit them said that they were very good. I'll go with that.

As you can probably tell, I'm a veteran. Georgetown seems like a neat place and very vet-friendly, so it'd be nice to get in. I have decent, but not great stats, so I know my chances are not that great, realistically. But it's like they say, "You never know until you try!"

Hi everyone
I'm new to this forum, but basically doing some background research before potential applying to GS. I was wondering whether anybody here (current GS student or otherwise), could comment on my suitability/chances of getting accepted.

Firstly - I am from the UK. So our school system is a quite different - there isn't really such thing as GPA for a start. Just to give you a really brief overview of the UK system:

School is mandatory up to the age of 16, where you do your GCSEs (general certificate of secondary education). Most students take about 9 subjects (the usual suspects - math, sciences, history, geography etc.) (Graded A* to F)

If you want to continue education 'Post16' - you typically go to what we call college. At college, you specialise in 3-4 subjects to attain 'A Levels'. A Levels take 2 years.

Then, if you have A-Levels, you can then apply to do a variety of undergraduate degrees at university.

OK - so sorry for the background info, but I'm guessing you won't all necessarily be totally familiar with the UK system.

Onto me. I left school at 16, after my GCSEs. I took 11, and got 5 A*s and 6As.

I started college, but left when I decided to start my own business. We're a tech company that make interactive lottery games. The secondary reason I left college was that I was, at that point in my life, fed up with education - I wanted to get out there!

The business has been pretty successful, but it's a long road - we're not there yet. We employ 40 people in London (ranging from software architects to graphic designers), and we're in the process of opening an office in NYC.

The reason I want to go to CGS is that having left school at 16, I am lacking some really core skills that'll allow me to stay at the top of the game when it comes to my business. I've got some matter between my ears, but no grounding from which to excel in the increasingly fast-paced business world that I find myself in.

I guess I'm looking for clarification on a couple of things;

-Does the fact that I haven't stretched myself academically since I was 16 (I'm 23 now), and therefore feel academically rusty, matter?

-Do most applicants have education at a much higher level, i.e. beyond high school?

-Would they likely want to see me first get some good grades at a lesser school in the US to build up a more common GPA that they recognise?

Thanks for any help you can give - and sorry for the essay.

Oh - and I'd be considering a Econ-PoliSci major, providing my quant is up to scratch.

And one last thing - I would be paying for my education using my own cash, cash that I have earned from the success thus far of my business.

Cheers

Stats - Age:25
High school gpa - ~3.5
What I did inbetween now and then:
I worked the gubernatorial campaign for McGreevy in high school, when I graduated I worked several odd jobs; Cooking, bartender, bodyguard. I then decided to go to culinary school at the French Culinary Institute in NYC. After graduating I worked at Craft, Frog and the Peach and Grounds for Sculpture. I then decided it wasn't for me and found a new job, at a drug discovery company of all places. While there I met some interesting people and decided I was definitely going to go back to school. In the mean time when that ended, I worked at a company that turned cadaver and porcine skin into skin grafts. While working there I went to Kean University and held a 3.8 for 2 semesters, but had to leave due to family issues. Then I worked at a environmental testing company.

Current school: Ocean County College
GPA- 4.0
Major - Econ/Math

Hi folks,

I received my letter of acceptance today via Fed-Ex. I applied from a community college with a 3.89 GPA, and quite a history.

If I attend, I'll be entering GS at an age when most are graduating, but I'm grateful for it -- I've got a clear vision of how I'll spend my time at Columbia. It ought to be great.

Good luck all,
D.M.

Hello! I just got accepted to the Reims campus, and I have a few questions for @vossari and @lion4546 ...
1. How is the workload? I definitely like my free time to relax or party and don't want to be too bombarded by work or have to struggle to spend time with friends and still study.
2. How did you choose housing? Are some areas better than others? Would you recommend a homestay (for ease and thriftiness- I am already fluent in French)?
3. What are internships like? I know that 1 is required the first summer, but do most people do any more?
4. How long are your breaks/how often do you have days off?
5. How does the French grading scale convert/carry over into the second two years-- is it completely separate (separate GPA)?
6. How many of the classes are in French?

That's all my questions for now... thank you so much! 




_____ACCEPTED______

@juliaxa Congratulations!!! And I'm happy to help - looking forward to meeting you too 

@xoxoPaulina Some of us were surprised to learn our program even has a waitlist; I guess it's because the program is getting more and more applicants but staying the same size. I would do as @DualDegreeSeeker suggested. Email them reiterating your interest in the program - tell them it's your dream choice and that you will go if you are accepted off the waitlist (assuming that's true). But depending on the campus, there MAY be a fair chance they will take a couple waitlist people, as I know there will probably be a couple people who don't choose the program for financial or other reasons.

And FYI I'm pretty sure most of us felt as if our interviews were really bad, haha - that's mostly because of the poker face and the grilling the Sciences Po interviewer gives you. I thought I totally blew my chances at getting into the program after my interview.

@reims17 To add on to some of what @vossari said:
5. Apparently Columbia is pretty generous with the grade conversion from Sciences Po, which gives us a nice advantage in terms of GPA when we arrive at Columbia. Actually the valedictorian of the School of General Studies last year was a Dual BA student. And Patrick Martinez said the Dual BA students have the highest GPA out of all of the students at Columbia (I guess average GPA of Dual BA students compared to students at other schools?).
6. Yeah, you don't have to take any classes in French (except the required French class if you aren't fluent). BUT you certainly can take classes in French if you're so inclined! At least in Le Havre, if you are B2 French or higher, you have to take your elective in French OR a second language from the region of focus (so Asian language for us). If your French is A1 to B1, you don't have to take a French elective (and you probably should not, as it will be very difficult for you) or a second language unless you want to.

Natdcny
Campaigner, I've noticed your post on past threads, are you a current student?

Yup, current student. I entered fall 2011, graduating May 2015. I'll be an orientation leader, and might be at your APS, so say hi!

----
The pool you see on College Confidential is much more serious than the general applicant pool.
----
Motame: plenty of economics majors come in with no calculus. I'd even say it's typical. A fair number even take precalc here. Don't worry about that.

Motame, the event a previous Saturday was Bacchanal. It's a great event, but it is the party of the year. While Columbians do reach that sometimes, don't expect it regularly. This year featured Macklemore. Past performers include Snoop Dogg, Vampire Weekend, Destiny's Child, Kanye West, Outkast, They Might Be Giants, Ben Folds Five.

----
Regarding 4.0 GPAs, sure, it helps. But GS is GS because they don't just blindly follow numbers like that. They care about your story. A 4.0 taking one motorcycle maintenance class per semester isn't very impressive, while a 3.6 taking 21 credits of difficult classes with a kid and a full time job is remarkable. GS understands and cares.

That said, yes, a higher GPA does make it more likely you'll be accepted. 




_____REJECTED______

Thanks!

Call at 3:33, managed to reach them again at 3:45.

Terrible high school GPA (<2). Just a few credits short of diploma 2003. Near perfect GED in 2009. 7 completed credits (4.0) at the continuing education branch of a state university, plus 9 in progress. SAT in 2002: 1320.

However in my favor I had lots of professional, impressive work experience. Fantastic recommendations (including a work related rec from a columbia alum w/ PhD). Very good essay (2900 words).


EDIT: I've had rejections or deferrals (i.e., rejection until after this semester grades) from almost all the other schools I applied to (one hasn't gotten back to me yet). There's hope yet for some of you!  




_____UNKNOWN______

 I agree with campaigner's bit on GPA.

As a high schooler, I was not a big fan of math -- I had taken pre-calculus almost six years ago, and done poorly. But I dove headfirst into Calc 1 - 3, Differential Equations and a computer science at my community college, and managed an A in all but Calc 3 (B) and Computer Science (B+).

Those two B's, alongside the rest of my courseload (Chinese language, honors classes etc.) were of no consequence. My 3.89 was hard-earned -- anyone could see that; I challenged myself, and it paid off! Mathematics? Not so bad after all. 




_____ACCEPTED______

Accepted. I’m shocked. Here are my stats. Hope it helps someone. Never stop believing in yourself!

App Type: Transfer

College/ Country: American Military University (Online)

College GPA: 3.7 @ AMU
3.3 @ a CC for my associates
0.67 for 1 semester @ a CC. I was forced to withdraw from 2/3 classes, which were marked as an F instead of W. I made sure to discuss this in my essay.

HS GPA: 2.7

Testing: GSAE

ECs: Students for the Exploration & Development of Space, former volunteer firefighter & EMT, Army Honor Guard

Hooks: Over 6 years of military service. Pursuing my dream of medical school, but I learned no medical schools will accept my online classes for the prerequisites.

I am not entering the postbac program. I was only entering my 3rd year of undergrad when I applied. Completing my degree online, then attending a postbac program would take about as long as earning a 4 year degree from Columbia. 




_____UNKNOWN______

My stats if anyone’s curious:

- 2.1 HS GPA
- 1.13 GPA at my first attempt De Anza CC
- Associates at BMCC with a 3.73 GPA (second attempt)
- Phi Theta Kappa

EC:
- Team Rubicon volunteer
- Apple Store Sales Specialist
- Bank Teller
- US Army infantryman 4yrs
- Barista

One rec letter from Army company commander and one from professor at current CC. I wrote about how I failed miserably in HS and my first attempt at CC, what I did to improve myself my second attempt, and how GS would be a good fit. I took the GSAE and wrote a bad essay because I didn’t know there was a time limit. Didn’t submit any SAT/ACT scores as I took them while I was in HS. I strongly believe my essay is what pulled me through! 




_____UNKNOWN______

I am also in. The only reason I'm able to type so calmly is because I've had a few hours to calm down LOL. I am still in disbelief. I'll post my stats below if it helps any current/future applicants (reading other people's stats while lurking on this thread was very helpful):

App Type: Transfer

College: Another top college

High School GPA: 2.2 (very lazy)

Recent college GPA: 4.0 (went to another school before current one and had a lower but decent GPA. Really turned it around recently).

Test Scores: SAT but scores were old (I'm in my late 20's). Took GSAE but don't know the score. I didn't encounter any issues with timing on the essay but I felt terrible for you guys that did! I'm so happy you were admitted (:

EC's and Hooks: Police supervisor/SWAT for seven years, former tactical EMT. Semi-pro athlete. Three professors at current college that wrote me letters and one was a Columbia alum. I personally think I had a solid essay. It's my one "academic" thing I'm naturally good at (math, not so much). The one thing I "picked up" from my visit to campus before I applied was that the essay(s) are a big deal. I ended up forwarding midterm results and a supplemental essay about a week prior to the deadline as a last-ditch effort. Apparently it didn't hurt. I also cold-visited them. I wore a suit and set up an in-person appointment with admissions to get advice on the application process.

Tips for current/future applicants: Really focus on the essay. Have other people read it and give feedback. I studied the SAT book pretty hard to prep for the GSAE. Nail your current semester of whatever college you are at and don't hold back on telling them every cool thing you've done on your application/resume. I don't know exactly what they look for or what the formula is, but that's what worked for me, apparently. Treat the whole thing like a job interview.

...and congratulations to everyone else that got in!!! I've been quite humbled to read the backgrounds of you all. I'm certainly in accomplished company. And for those still waiting, best of luck. Don't give up hope! You're probably better/more accomplished/more unique than you think you are.

Hey guys,

I applied Feb 23rd and was accepted yesterday at 5:05 PM! Here are my stats:

High School GPA: 3.1
College GPA: 3.73 (UMUC)
SAT: 1490/1600 (New SAT)
GSAE
Major: Computer Science

I'm a network engineer working for a defense contractor. I served 6 years active-duty Air Force, and I'm now a reservist. I was initially only going to take the GSAE, but I decided to take the SAT in March in case I didn't get into Columbia. Even though my SAT results came out on March 23rd, past the deadline for supplemental materials, Columbia still accepted the results. I feel like Neilson Phu's College Panda SAT Writing book prepared me very well for the GSAE.

I worked with Service2School and they were a godsend. I definitely recommend that all future veterans applying reach out to them.

On my essay, I spent about half of it going over my history up to the present and the other half going over my future plans and why Columbia.

I'm thinking about deferring to Spring 2020 because my girlfriend's application to the New York State Bar Association is looking like it will take about 6 months to process. 




_____ACCEPTED______

I thought I would post my stats for any useful reference:

Got my acceptance packet via Fedex on April 25th and a call from the admissions office later that same day! I haven't posted at all in this thread, but I have definitely been following it. I didn't submit my application until March 17th and my transcripts didn't arrive until April 2nd.

High school (unweighted): 3.7 GPA
SAT: 1840 combined, no ACT
2 years of suffolk county community college honors program: 4.0 GPA
Extracurriculars: Honors club and Phi Theta Kappa

My essay is what I think did it for me. I wrote about the hardships and challenges I've had to overcome in order to get the education I think I deserve. I'll try to summarize it briefly. I was born in Colombia and raised in America by my single mother. My mom was basically the working-father figure and I was the mother figure for my younger siblings. From a young as I was driven to make my mom proud so I excelled in school and got a significant scholarship for a private high school education. Half way through high school I had immigration problems and almost got deported. I married my high school sweetheart during my first year at Suffolk. After graduating with my associates, I took a gap year and worked as an assistant manager at a gourmet food shop. I got my green card in January and decided to apply to Columbia soon after. I turn 21 in June, which made my story very out of the ordinary for my age.

Congratulations to all those accepted for Fall 2013! Those who haven't received anything yet try not to have a conniption while waiting (Tom Petty comes to mind). I posted early in this thread when I first applied. I was, and still am, hesitant to post my status/stats. As much as I am happy for all my (soon to be) fellow classmates and myself, I am aware of how nerve-racking this process can be. Posting good news feels a little like bragging so I am a little reluctant; the last thing I want to do is sharpen the sting of anyone’s rejection. However, if I had received a rejection, I would not rub salt in my wound by continuing to follow this thread.

Furthermore, the CC Columbia GS Fall Early Action ‘11, ‘12 & ‘13 threads have helped me through this process. In the hopes of continuing the college confidential tradition of helpful insight and transparency for future and current applicants, I will post my status and stats despite my initial reticence.

First campus visit was August 2012, then second in March for GSAE.
Been in contact with admissions office semi-regularly.
Interview last week, no call back on the following Monday (which was nerve-racking because according to this thread many interviewees received a call back on the following business day). My worries were all for not because Tuesday I received the call. The admissions manager I interviewed with informed me that I had been accepted for admission.

HS 2002 local diploma: 75.5 weighted average. Ranked 311th out of 354 students.
ACT scores:
(From 2001(so since they were not in the last 5 years I don’t think they counted towards my decision), Keep in mind that academics were not a priority during my HS years; I did not try to score well, in fact Columbia got these scores from my HS, to be completely honest, I do not remember taking the ACT’s)
ACT-SCORES
12/2001
ACT test scores 20
math 15
reading 21
sci-reason - 21
composite - 19
Percentile: at or below 40

CC GPA from three semesters in the early 2000’s: 0.06
Current Community College GPA(from spring 2011-present): 3.83
Current majors: Liberal Arts: polysci concentration & Human Service

Essay/history/auto-bio:
“Homeless to Harvard/Heroine Junkie to Honor Roll”.

Defined by dysfunction and addiction since 13. Continuing a long family history (as in generations) of the same cycle of degradation. Homeless from 18 to 25 yrs. First in my family to break this cycle. My recovery, service work and academic pursuits paved the way for sibling to follow suit and lost contact with father from 13. Other parent (mom) showed incredible vigor and tough love despite the rest of her immediate family's troubles. This GS acceptance is just as much a testament to her resilience and strength as it is a confirmation of my liberation from moral bankruptcy and my commitment to atonement. I am now on a mission with no name or underlining cause other than to serve as a beacon of hope and benevolence to others.

Anticipated Major(s): Social science; either Sociology or political science. Law school hopeful, would like to practice law in the arena of social justice.

I live about 250 miles away right now. I am not a man of financial means; I do not have family with money either. In fact, right now I have no idea how I will come up with the $500 deposit; not to mention the cost of moving and getting set up in NYC, but this is a once in a lifetime (if that) opportunity and I am not letting money stop me from attending this fall.

Really looking forward to meeting many of you in the fall!!
Good luck everyone.

Both of those students have 4.0+ gpa's and jave genius level IQ's. Unless you're a bonagide genius, which these people are, it's next to impossible to graduate with a really high gpa without devoting a significant amout of your life to studying. And if you're not obsessed with getting really good grades, then you'll definately be in the minority at this school.

I'll be graduating in a 2 weeks. I was inducted into the Honor's Society and Phi Beta Kappa, and I'll be going to a presitgious law school in the fall (top 5). I lived a pretty balanced life - worked out everyday, joined a frat, and I'm in a relationship - but most of my time was geared towards school-work. It all depends on what you want out of this experience. I wanted to get a high gpa and get into a top law school, and to do those things it took many long, sleepless nights in Butler, writing papers weeks in advance, and studying 8+ hourse a day.

@stringtheories I didn't have any time off from school and I was accepted. They asked me in an email if I intended to go part-time/full-time and I told them I was planning on going full-time so I didn't even have the "compelling reason" to attend part time. I'd encourage you to apply.

My stats are on page 7 but I'll repost them here for your convenience.

I failed out of a four-year school. I got a job working for the state in maintenance; I realized I didn't want to be doing that type of work forever. So I went back to school. (there was no year + gap, so giving hope to anyone in the same situation as me) I worked full-time and went to school full-time. Eventually my CFO noticed my hard work and offered me a job working in finance.

One thing I really focused on was how it took me until after I failed out to realize the value of education. 




_____UNKNOWN______

@nickdrake I do have a fair amount of credits. I am expecting 50-60 to transfer My GPA has been a bit chaotic, however. From '06-'08 I completed 28 credits at a community college while working full-time. I left there with roughly a 3.0. The following year I transferred to a state college where I did not do well. My grades there were abysmal, as I was dealing with some stuff in my personal life during my time at community college and the university. After leaving school in 2009, I took corrective action to get my life back on track. I returned to school in the summer of 2015. I completed 10 semester credits that summer, 16 in the fall and am currently taking 15 this spring. I have only received 1 B since returning to school, and I have retaken, and earned As in, a couple of courses where I previously did not excel. Also, most of my courses that I bombed at the state college were toward a different major. So, as I said, a bit chaotic, and probably a complex applicant to evaluate. My cumulative GPA has become a complex Calc equation at this point. I believe that I have a fairly respectable professional resume with 10+ year of work history. My letters of recommendation should be very compelling, I hope. And my extracurriculars are decent.

The business has been pretty successful, but it's a long road - we're not there yet. We employ 40 people in London (ranging from software architects to graphic designers), and we're in the process of opening an office in NYC.

The reason I want to go to CGS is that having left school at 16, I am lacking some really core skills that'll allow me to stay at the top of the game when it comes to my business. I've got some matter between my ears, but no grounding from which to excel in the increasingly fast-paced business world that I find myself in.

I guess I'm looking for clarification on a couple of things;

-Does the fact that I haven't stretched myself academically since I was 16 (I'm 23 now), and therefore feel academically rusty, matter?

-Do most applicants have education at a much higher level, i.e. beyond high school?

-Would they likely want to see me first get some good grades at a lesser school in the US to build up a more common GPA that they recognise?

Thanks for any help you can give - and sorry for the essay.

Oh - and I'd be considering a Econ-PoliSci major, providing my quant is up to scratch.

And one last thing - I would be paying for my education using my own cash, cash that I have earned from the success thus far of my business.

Cheers

As a former Californian; Let me point out that just because you are accepted at "non-haas" Berkeley, or any UC for that matter, doesnt necessarily translate to automatic GS acceptance. And here is why:

- As a California Resident, UC's HEAVILY favor California Community College students versus any one else outside the state. A student with a 3.7 with barely any EC's from a CCC WILL be accepted over a student with a 3.9 with lots of EC's from New York. In fact ( although I hate to use analogies for obvious reasons ) , FOUR of my friends from a CCC that had a high 3.6 with barely any extracurriculars got in to the College of Letter and Science & the college of Engineering. Why? Well, this has alot to do with overpopulation and the fact that the state has an extremely high unemployment rate ( probably because there is so much fun stuff to do that people tend to forget about school at a young age plus too many people moving into California ). The main reason I actually moved out of California was because I could not concentrate in school. In fact, most UC's ( not including Berkeley and UCLA) have TAG ( Transfer Acceptance Agreements ) where all you need is to take "X" amount of courses and maintain a 3.0 would constitute an automatic acceptance. Moral of the story, as a CCC student you dont have to be "smart" per se to get into a UC like " non- haas "Berkeley. Honestly, in a state where a 3.0 is looked at by your peers as "phenomenal," you just need to be able to follow directions and maintain a certain GPA and your basically a shoe in.

In Addition, from what I am reading on the forum, to gain acceptance to GS means to be not JUST non-traditional, in most cases the odds are IN FAVOR of EXTREMELY non-traditional; i.e Campaigning for some hot shot Senator or whatever for a couple years, Dodging bullets as a Green Buret, or raised in extreme poverty while raising children while maintaining a high GPA.

So as with Berkeley, in most cases, you need the minimum GPA and a few clubs here and there. Where Columbia GS you dont neccessarily need a high GPA as much as you need a great story ( although in plenty of cases it appears most have great GPA's)

Yes, Berk has a 21 % acceptance rate, but I am willing to bet that plenty of those applicants ( especially CCC students because they like to party, bon fires etc etc ) have Gpa's below 3.6. In california, UCB and UCLA are those dream schools that people just apply to any way because, " Why not? , Im applying to UCI and UCSD, why not UCB for the heck of it?"

In a state where UC grads come at a dime a dozen, I can totally see why even a Columbia GS education would be a wise investment; small class sizes, and besides the Columbia name would be an eye opener in a sea of UC resumes in California.

LOL I couldn't help but laugh reading Random's post- "raised in extreme poverty while raising children while maintaining a high GPA" - that's me, the EXTREMELY non-traditional student. Just got admitted a couple weeks ago, and I do have a 4.0 GPA which I managed to obtain while taking Honors classes, volunteering a BUNCH, etc. etc., AND raising four kids, in EXTREME poverty (our income is about $900 per year- yikes). It's been difficult...but I feel like it's all been worth it and I'm finally going to give my kids the life they deserve, thanks to GS. Now I'm just waiting on that financial aid letter...

Going into the Combined Major - Art History & Visual Arts. 




_____REJECTED______

Yeah ton, it's definitely possible I'll apply again for the spring semester. And you're right, I'll pretty much have everything already ready to go sans the app fee. Thank you for the support man, I really appreciate it.
Random, I gotta be honest with you.. I think I know what it was. Some years back, during my 'cowboy' days, I had a run-in with the law that had me do 5 months in Riker's Island. Crazy, I know, but luckily for my sake, I did everything I was supposed to do in terms of my probation afterwards, and didn't end up with a felony on my record. In the midst of the whole ordeal, I stopped and took a look at how I was living, and decided that I couldn't go on like that. So I truly and completely started doing the right things, academic and otherwise, and never looked back.
Now, this might sound stupid to some, but I touched on the situation in my essay. Why? Because it was a building block for who I am today.. An essential piece in making me the highly motivated, 'shoot for the moon' kind of person I've become. I know I could've omitted it all out and slyly worked around it, but after living with something to hide for so long, I just don't like to be like that anymore. I'm not ashamed of where I come from. And in fact, I'm proud. I'm proud that I came this far. 'Cause at 1 time, I had it all - loving support, smarts, talent, ambition - without the scars. I even skipped 4th grade, for God's sake. But somewhere along the line, my immaturity got the best of me and I threw it all away. Miraculously, though, I was able to gain it all back. Through years of hard work. And so when I went for my interview, the lady asked me about it all, and I was very honest about it. I'm sure, though, it was something that didn't appeal to her.
I just wish she knew and trusted the real me. Who I am; and who I was as a kid. Because If she did, I really feel like I'd be in. I thought my GPA, community service, and overall contrition for said situation in the interview would be enough to attest to my qualifications, but apparently not. And that's the baggage I have to carry, at least for now still.
I know some people might say, 'Hey buddy, you get arrested, and you think you're getting into GS? Are you kidding me?' And to those people, primarily I'll say it was worth a shot. Why not? I've been doing everything I should have been doing academically the last few years.. My favorite motto is 'shoot for the moon.. If you miss, you're still amongst those stars.' So I gave it a chance. But secondly, I'll also say 'I hear you.' I hear where you're coming from, and I understand your position. I say that because I feel like the amount of people that have made mistakes like me, only to truly redeem themselves morally and otherwise, and go to live productive lives, is slim to none. So as soon as some people hear the word 'arrested,' they almost automatically assume a person will always be that certain way, and attach that stigma to him as well. It's okay, though. That's part of that baggage I was talking about. And it's what makes me strive harder and harder each and every day. With this rejection, I kind of feel like Tom Brady getting drafted in the 6th round. Somebody who knows they have talent and can confidently perform at a very high level that gets overlooked. I just hope that you Random, and everyone else in this forum that is waiting for an answer, get in. It's a great school, and obviously everyone that gets to go there is very fortunate and talented. But if you don't, I'm sure you know that you still have a very real and good chance to succeed. As long as you work hard, develop strong bonds, and continue on the path that you're on - because if you're applying to GS with any realistic shot of getting in, you're already on the right one.. you shouldn't have a problem. And like I wrote in my last post, I just truly wish everyone the best, and hope that you all get to end up where you wanna be.

Congrats to everyone that got in!
And as Random just said, I'll also post my stats here.

I was accepted to GS as a transfer, after a year in SUNY Binghamton.
SAT 1: verbal 730, math 750, writing 720.
SAT 2: math II 800, phys 800
GPA in Binghamton(while applying): 3.93 (3.96 now)
ECs: since I only stayed there for one year, really couldn't get any leadership positions. member of SIFE team(a business group), student ambassador, member of McKenna 5K committee(which organizes an annual memorial run), member of the crew team.
life story: went to college in China right after high school, did ok with a 3.1-ish GPA, and came to the US after a year there. My family underwent some difficulties and I stopped education and started working. Worked 3 jobs at the same time over a two-year period to help my family settle down, and then I went to Binghamton to continue study.

my essay was mostly about my struggle during the years outside school and how the experience has changed me. To my surprise, the essay came out very well.
I handed in the application on Mar 2nd(yeah.. one day after EA), and had a phone interview on Apr.27th. She basically asked me what I was doing for the past years, how I was doing in college now, why I chose the major Econ+Math, and what I'll be doing if I was not accepted(duh!). The decision came out really fast, within two days or so. I was so excited but still had a week of hell during the coming finals, as they asked for the final transcript.

Hope my story helps. In my case, I think it's my change that they're satisfied with.

Once again, congratulations to all that got in, and good luck to everyone that's still waiting! Hope to see you soon

Hello my Dear Forumers!!
I have not been here in a whileeeee! I almost feel like a stranger! Hehehe 
I hope life has been treating you well so far! I know some of you probably wondered “whatever happened to Invictus?”. Well, here are the details:
I was not accepted, but before sharing the details with you all, I wanted to know the details from CU in order to provide some insightful information to those who will eventually visit this forum for information.
Btw…hey Baxter! I got your msg, thanks for the inquiry, I’m sure today’s response will suffice an answer 
I had a post-phone-interview to discuss the negative outcome of my app. The admissions officer told me – in a nutshell – that I didn’t have enough Liberal courses, which I don’t. Most of my courses are “professionally oriented” in business. Even though I had a 3.72 GPA, they wanted to see more Liberal Arts courses in my curriculum and or quantitative ( I took CalcI & Stats- got an A) but I guess that wasn’t enough. Most of my Business/Accounting courses did not transfer to CU towards my decided major ,FE, which is the major that I wanted to go for. They told me that if I took some more LibArts courses and kept getting good grades that the outcome would be better if I decide to re-apply in the future....So that’s my story!
I kept bugging you all to share your stories, so here is mine  Life is about moving forward and this was a good experience even if I didn’t get the outcome I wanted, this has motivated me to work even harder now and I hope that all of you keep thriving for your dreams and never give up. In the words of BuzzLightYear…”Never give up, Never SURRENDER!!” LOL! 
I hope you are all enjoying your Summer. I had a great time on this forum and I really enjoyed our moments of anxiety together.hehehe. Right now, I’ve enrolled in Plan B and I will keep moving forward and hopefully I will see some of you at CU’s SB –MBA, cause I plan to go there .
Best of wishes and have a great Summer my Dear Forumers!!  




_____ACCEPTED______

I was accepted! I've been on here for some time, keeping an eye on this thread in particular. Thought I'd post my stats:

GPA: 3.94
SAT: 1920
School: Brookdale Community College
Major: English

Background:
Graduated from an Honors Program
Obtained Distinguished Scholar Award
Created a gaming company early in high school called Delvice Studios
Started modeling in high school
I play piano
Fluent in French and Polish, proficient in Spanish
Spent an extended amount of my childhood overseas (In Bolivia and Poland)
High school wasn't the sunniest period of my life
Worked multiple jobs straight out of high school while helping my parents out with their separate companies

For my essay I focused on the importance of diversity in my life.I chose to write the optional essay on the hardships I suffered right out of high school. (I'd be more descriptive but it's too personal!)

Though I majored in English at the community college I went to, I can't help but reevaluate my academic pathway while attending Columbia. There are soooo many enticing majors that I just can't decide! Right now I'm thinking between: Comparative Literature and Society, Philosophy, Political Science, or Astrophysics.

Good luck to everyone still waiting for a response! Don't give up hope!

I'd like to give a special thanks to wwwlk18, sylo23, chasethecarrot, CuNyu2011, JamesInGlendale, and HYPSMCo for their information! Also a thanks to everyone who posted stats, those were really interesting!

Good afternoon everyone!!

So I had my interview...


Overall, I'd say it went well. Ivonne Rojas is a very nice lady, with lots of pertinent questions! The conversation lasted 26min, was laid back and we even joked a couple of times...

I felt that I answered all the questions the right way. She responded to my comments by saying "Now I totally understand your choices," "It makes sense," etc...

I'm originally a Fine Art students but I want to be an economics/poli-sci major in Columbia GS. Even though my GPA at my CC is good (3.83) and I have an AA degree with Economics/International Poli-sci classes they were still worried about me being able to handle the workload...
I guess my answer was good because she said "we can definitely see that you have a very strong and hard work ethic"

BUT (there's always a but)

I feel that I could have convinced her more. I was not the "passionate" student that was trying to strongly prove a point and show determination. I was this normal person having a normal conversation, answering questions about why my not so good grades in high school and why since I moved to the USA I'm this successful, perfectionist and workaholic person... (my answer was maturity).

She also asked me the classes that were the hardest. I was honest and told her that my English comp II honors class was the hardest (the only B I have) because even after three years living in the US we can still spot the detail that shows I'm not a native English speaker.

She said that Econ was heavy in math and that so far I did not have many math classes... which is definitely true even though with work I don't feel it will be an issue in the end.

Finally, the last question just killed me! "What if you're not accepted to Columbia? What is you backup plan?"
I answered I was already admitted in the university I'm currently working at (University of Central Florida). I said I would go there, that my major would be Economics with an International Business minor. She replied surprised "Ah, so no matter what you still want to pursue your studies?"

I want a bachelor, masters, and even PhD. degrees... I though I was clear on this in my application...


I guess I'm just going insane. I'd better drink some tea and go to bed :-p

@mllJack, Yeah, I hoped we could meet for laughs about the whole thing. I was truly disappointed after receiving news that I had been rejected. It's fine, though. I'll dust myself off and try again.
Here are my stats:

GPA: 3.75
104 Hours of Community Service in high school (retirement homes, organizing events etc)
Newspaper reporter for 2 years
Board member of the International Affairs Committe of Student Gov't at my college.
News Director at my campus radio station.
Board member of the student election review committee.
Vice President of the CUny International Student Coalition.
Represented my country and college at a United Nations COnference in Melbourne, Australia.
International Delegate at the US Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Conference.
Conducted an exclusive interview with Trinidad and Tobago's first female Prime Minister while in New York.

IN my essay I focused on international events, how intriguing I find it, being exposed to diveristy @ an early age re: me attending a Hindu Primary School..then an all boy Catholic High School...how my university search was driven by the need to be a part of a diverse environment. Interests etc etc etc.

Recs from a professor (former high school teacher of my Prime Minister)..and an Albanian political scientist.

I have an appointment to discuss the rejection...so maybe I can get in next semester. Good luck to all those who have been accepted and to those still awaiting a response!

Hey everyone, not to get too far off base but I'm applying to the School of general studies for spring 2012 admittance. I would be applying for fall 2011 but I'm still in Afghanistan at the moment and will be until the end of September. Could anyone take a look and let me know what my odds are looking like for transfer? My admissions councilor says I'm a strong candidate but I'd like to hear from people who have already applied.

- I spent 1.5 years studying at the United States Military Academy at West Point
- I had a 3.4 GPA there doing 20-22 credits a semester, plus NCAA D1 fighting, plus thesis work outside of class and serving as a TA (My grades were all A's and B's, no C's)
- I won the Annual Student Mathematics award in a class of 1200+
- SAT's were about 1350-1380 (old score)
- I have Shining recommendations from 4 professors at West Point (2 Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics) including the teachers I did the thesis work with.
- I had a pretty lame HS GPA at 3.25 but tried to pass that in my essay with the explanation that my Dad was deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq for an aggregate total of 3 years between middle school and HS and I had to help my mom with my 3 siblings, all younger than myself (etc. etc.)
- I smashed the essay and like to think I was more than a bit manipulative in my writing.
- I explained my break in education as a moral obligation I felt to deploy with my former unit as they prepared to go to one of the more hostile providences of Afghanistan.

I've already been admitted to Vanderbilt University and the only other schools I'm applying to are Cornell (Close to home and my Dad's school), and Columbia (love the city and it's close to friends at West Point.)

Affirmation and advise are more than welcome. Thanks

I have a friend who is going to start Columbia GS this fall and these were her stats and life story:

Applying from: American River College in Sacramento,California
Accepted: Columbia GS, UC Davis, UCSC, UCI
Rejected: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD
Major: Anthropology B.A
GPA: 3.14
Major Prerequisites: Done
Major GPA: 3.41
SAT: 1500/2400
IGETC/General Education requirements for GS: Done
ECs/Work Experience: Volunteer at the share institute, works at the transfer center (32 hours a week) and at a kids science camp (16 hours per week)


Life story: She first enrolled at the community college right after high school in 2000 but she dropped out after one year because she only had a 2.0 gpa and she got discouraged from going to school as she was not involved on campus and no one guided her. She then worked full time for five years as a waiter at a casino and a few odd jobs here and there.
In 2006, she decided to go back to school and in her fist semester back, she did ok with a 3.0 GPA but while going to school and working at the same time, the apartment she was living at evicted her because she was not able to pay the monthly rent as she was putting most of her limited budget into school, and food. Even financial aid was not enough to put her through. She then had to live in a homeless shelter close to campus for six months and at the same time, she still went to school and worked full time in the transfer center trying to put her life back together. It was during her stay in the homeless shelter that she got interested in anthropology as she was exposed to different people and cultures. She still managed to get a 3.0 average during her stay in the shelter. Her family tried to help her during the ordeal she had to go through but it still was not enough as they were going through with financial problems of their own. She eventually found another apartment to live at.
Her work and volunteer experiences reinforces her openness to other cultures and her ultimate goal is to earn a Ph.D in cultural anthropology and do research on California Native Americans.

Hooks and other information: She is the first in her whole family to attend college
In her last 70 semester units, she was able to get a 4.0 average.
30 years old
Applied Early Decision

This shows the level of holism that Columbia has as compared to UCLA and Berkeley when reviewing applicants. She did not have the highest GPA or the best SAT scores, but her personal statement put her over the top.
