Just a few points of advice:\n\n1. Follow Dr. Graves Admission Blog: ugaadmissions.blogspot.com you will find lots of very helpful information.\n\n2. IGNORE HIS GPA AS CALCULATED ON HIS TRANSCRIPT! Calculate his UGA gpa. If your school does not add weight to the actual letter grade then calculate those actual grades in core academic courses adding 1pt to all the AP grades, not honors!! If your school adds weight to the actual grade on the transcipt (very few do) then do not add the 1pt for AP. Detailed information on how to do this on the blog.\n\n3. Is the score on the SAT the only available test? UGA superscores so he may have an opportunity to increase the score.\n\n4. Course Rigor is very important. From what you have posted it seems as though he will not have a problem in this area.\n\n5. The class coming in for Fall 2015 is extremely strong. If you son is somewhat competitive then I think he should go ahead and apply for early action. It certainly is nice to get that admission decision in December. If that doesn't work in his favor then he would complete the second portion of the application, essays etc. and hope for an admission in Feb or March. Those admitted in February are generally early students who have increased their stats and now meet the early admissions level (ie increased their gpa or SAT score) or regular admission people who meet the early average. The balance of admission in March are looked at on a more holistic view.\n\nMy daughter is an incoming freshman from OOS. I am very curious to know the number of OOS freshman this year, it seems that people from around the country have found UGA and are applying more.\n\nHope this helps! \n0  \u00b7  Reply \u00b7 Share on Facebook \n\n\n", "\n@WWAParent\u200c Hi, I posted above, and I got the same amount for a scholarship.

Suffice it to say that if you've got people in GS who have never written a paper, then perhaps they should spend some time in a CC where they won't be burning 50k a year on tuition, housing and Top Ramen to feed the GS machine.\n\nIn the case of Columbia GS, you should FORGET about the brand name at all. It'll impress your friends back in Dogdick, but against the kind of academic pedigree I described, it won't stand alone. You play your Columbia GS card wrong and try to pass yourself off as a CC grad and you will not only not open doors, you'll find doors being slammed in your face. People are prickly about that stuff: and rightfully so.\n\nNetworks? I won't even begin to address the idea of a meritocracy in NYC. Old money talks. Dynastic wealth talks. Your last name talks. Your school talks. Your society connections talk. Your GPA and your GS degree? Yeah, they talk. They just don't speak as loudly as the 22 year old whose Uncle is a VP at Chase and whose family owns a summer house next to the head of BofA in ACK.\n\nYou can do plenty if you hustle, sure. But that's who you're going to be up against. Explain that to your lenders when they want their $250,000 back.\n\nAnd let's talk Greek networks for a minute. Unless you make a VERY firm connection in a VERY old frat, a Greek network is FAR too small to trump something like a school. If we had societies like at Yale, final clubs like at Hahvahd, or eating clubs like Princeton, that might be one thing, but the social structure here isn't built that way. There's ONE secret society (ok, one and a half) at Columbia and trust me, they're not letting just anyone in. Most people write them off, but that's the stuff that matters. We're cliquish.\n\nVarsity athletics? Some of you may be former pro. athletes and therefore ineligible to participate in NCAA athletics. But beyond that, I'm assuming that most of you are older than the average college student. Can you keep up with a 20 year old runner/swimmer/rower? I'll grant that there are some military guys (and women--I'm not ignoring you ladies) who can probably smoke these kids, but they're the exception. Kind of closes that door unless you're a real trooper.\n\nLook. Come here if you want. Columbia's great. The academics are excellent. Aside from the massive amount of debt I'm incurring and the fact that I'm going to have to find a way to prove that I'm actually BETTER than my highly-suspect GS degree, I'm happy here and there's no reason you won't be either.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Ask some of these people. Ask the GS cheerleaders, the GS naysayers. Come here and look around. HANG OUT with people who ACTUALLY go here.\n\nI'm happy to extend the same courtesies that were extended to me when I was applying. If you want to see the UWS through my eyes, shoot me a PM when you're gonna be in NYC and I'll be happy to take you around. I'll even introduce you to GSers who love GS and who argue with me about these points. It'll be far from an official tour, but I promise it'll be more fun.\n\nJust know that GS isn't CC. It's not supposed to be. Don't get sucked into this place just because it'll say Columbia.\n\nThere's a hierarchy here and you'd better believe that GS is at the bottom of it. ", "\nAnother current GS student here. FYI: I am a peer and classmate of BoolaBoola's so I can vouch for BB's upstanding character and sincerity. I don't know if I've met Hellojan in real life on campus, but his/her record on this very board speaks for itself. This is a thread of knowledgeable folks offering real opinions, to which I will now submit my own.\n\n1st thing: University Studies. Boola brought it up and I shall tear it down and put it to rest. You should not concern yourselves with it at this point except to know that it exists and it is offensive. It is, ostensibly, a semester-long, no-credit, free, yet required for some, course of lectures on subjects such as \"time management,\" \"exam preparation,\" and \"managing your digital life.\" Who is selected upon admission for this requirement and who is not remains a small mystery. But this semester's class is large . . . 50-60 people? That's out of a Spring semester admitted class of 110-120 people. Administration claims it ranges from community college transfers (but not all of them) to first-time college students, to students who have had prior academic difficulty, to students away from school for extended periods. I am none of these. I'm a 4-year school transfer w/ a 3.65 GPA. I did, however, withdraw my last semester at my prior school and thus have a semester of \"W\"s on my transcript. This appears to be my ticket to University Studies. It's useless. It's uninformative. It's an insult to the intelligence of anyone involved. End of story. Grin and bear it.\n\nMuch of what I would share with you is similar to what Boola has already said. But I would also urge you to note that I, like Boola, am still here and will stay here, despite any criticisms I might have. I came here to study in a specific department, to enrich my development as a scholar, and get into a top PhD program. Despite the frightening financial picture, academics trump all for me, at this point.\n\nBut GS is a separate school. This is fact. There are financial, social, cultural, and psychological ramifications to this that cannot be changed. They may be minor, but they're real. My advice to you is what I wish I had done, and that's be sure to consider other options (if you haven't already). I wish I had seen it through and applied to Yale's EWSP, as well as for transfer admission to UC Berkeley, peer/nearly-peer institutions with better financial aid outlooks and similarly strong academics.\n\nAs for admissions, GS doesn't publish this data so I don't know how some websites can claim to know that it is 28%, or 36%, or whatever number is proposed. My impression is that those numbers seem a bit low. We have some of the brightest bulbs, for sure, but some pretty dim ones too. For any of you with experience in university-level writing and reading of criticism, these are the bulbs who will darken the days of your University Writing class. Trudge through it. Twice a week I go directly from University Writing to an upper-division English seminar and my day is inevitable brightened. In lumine Tuo videbimus lumen, indeed.\n\nBest of luck to all. ", "\nGreetings,\n\nI have considered applying to Columbia GS, but would like to ask other prospective and recently admitted students to chance me.\n\nRaw Stats:\n\nHigh School GPA: 3.5\nEmmanuel College GPA: 3.5\nNorth Georgia College GPA: 3.85\nSAT: 1850\n\nI am a 23 year old, nontraditional student. After graduating from high school, I enrolled into a private, Christian college. Unfortunately, Emmanuel seemed to be more interested with denominational indoctrination than education. I was very dissatisfied, but decided to finish the semester.\n\nI spent the next 7 months being a caretaker for my ailing grandparents. During this period, I began to soul search and decided to enroll in a nearby state university. North Georgia College served my needs, in terms of costs and location, but did not provide the rigorous environment that I desired. Frustrated, I began to explore other opportunities, alternatives to higher education, that could offer me the intellectual stimulation that I craved. In 2009, I landed an internship with the International Centre for Reconstruction & Development. This was the opportunity that I had sought.\n\nI have spent the last two years promoting the liberalization of Nigeria. In collaboration with the Save Nigeria Group and Green Invasion Campaign, the ICRD has focused on the critical issues like infrastructure development, sufficient energy supply, and lowering the infant mortality rate. Although I mainly worked from the Atlanta office, in April of 2010, I had the opportunity to work in Nigeria and took it. I labored overseas for six months and loved it. Upon my return, I needed a job with better pay and signed on at Northeast Georgia Health Systems, Inc. as a medical observer.\n\nDuring free time, I am still actively working with contacts in Nigeria for the 2011 election, because my mentor and former employer is a candidate for the Vice Presidency.\n\nIn short, I am wanting to finish my undergraduate education and would like to study in a rigorous environment with extraordinary people. Columbia seems to be such a place. I would apply for RD fall '11. What chance do I stand? ", "\nCorrections:\n\nNorth Georgia College GPA: 3.9\nOverall GPA: 3.85\n\nI realize that my stats are a bit low and have considered retaking the SAT. I didn't use wisdom when I last took it, walked in after working a hellish, 12-hour shift in ICU.\n\nAnd the issue of costs doesn't concern me as much as the quality of education. While in college, most of the texts I read were written by Columbia professors like Joseph Stiglitz or Jeffrey Sachs. The questions they raised and theories they proposed have been critical in the work I've done in Nigeria. Also, Columbia has unparalleled opportunities, like the Earth Institute, to gain more knowledge and experience to help with Third World development. ", "\nHello everyone,\n\nSubmitted my app for early decision a while ago, still waiting for one transcript to process. I'm a Marine combat vet (former scout-sniper team leader, multiple combat tours), attended a community college, and I'm now at the University of Michigan in Dearborn. Had a rough time adjusting to the civilian world; I kind of came under some wanderlust after a rough breakup, climbed mountains, and neglected my studies. My GPA from the community college is only a 3.6, but if you exclude a nine credit hour class which I received a C in during my quest to find answers in solitude on the tops of mountains, then I have a 3.9 (40-some credit hours). I'm doing well at Michigan, just finished an eight week accelerated course which I earned an A in, so my Michigan transcript has me down for a 4.0 with three credit hours (hey, I'll take it) and 11 more which I'm in the process of completing.\n\nI drove to NYC a couple weekends back and took the GSAE, felt pretty good about it. Right now I live in an apartment by myself, work at a lumber yard in Detroit, and go to school full-time. I'm looking at GS's Middle Eastern Studies program or Poli Sci with an emphasis on IR. If I don't get in this time around then I'll to take a Spring semester at U of M - D and give GS another shot. I really wish you all the best of luck.\n\nThanks,\nMike\n\n(By the way, that nine credit hour class was an emergency medical technician course; like I said, I had a rough time and made some knee-jerk, scatterbrained decisions. Best of luck to you all.) ", "\n\"Admission to Columbia GS is highly selective. According to the College Board, the GS acceptance rate is 23%.

After 9/11, I decided to join the Marine Corps as a journalist because in spite of my anger towards the government, the idea of a group of men and women who believed in something enough to sign their lives to it was a novel concept to a boy surrounded by slum apathy. I was sent primarily to humanitarian assistance/disaster relief projects during my time in, detailing our efforts bringing aid to the third world. I had a great awakening during this time, realizing the parallels and contrasts between the poverty of my youth and in these nations. Going back to school on the GI Bill, I fell in love with books and became intensely interested in educational politics, because I felt that education was the key missing factor from each of these areas where the poor were so politically insecure and disaffected.

If you attend 24 hours of classes per week, this is about 5 hours per day. How do you then have time to study, read the material, write papers, join some extracurricular clubs, etc... ?\n\nSciences Po teaches students about time management and being strategic in your work. Despite the heavy workload, we manage to balance our school time with extracurriculars and other interests. Also, there is less outside work compared to Columbia, where you might really need a lot of time in the library, for example. At Sciences Po, students prepare oral presentations as the primary form of assessment.\n\n2. Do you have classes every day of the week? How about on Saturday?\nIf the grading is so harsh, how is credit earned for Columbia? Would a 13 be put as an A on Columbia's transcript or as a 65/100? How would that affect graduating with honors or graduate degree applications?\n\nGenerally, students have class every day of the week up until Thursday. Most do not have Friday classes, but there are some courses only offered on Fridays. There is no class on Saturday. To get credit for Sciences Po courses at Columbia, students need to achieve at least an 11. The Columbia GPA is only a sum of the grades received while at Columbia - therefore Sciences Po grades are not factored in. Alumni from the program have graduated with honors, and have been inducted into groups that recognize academic excellence such as the GS Honor Society and Phi Beta Kappa. For an official grade conversion scale, check out the Fulbright's evaluation: http://www.fulbright-france.org/docs/2010163656_NoticeN3.pdf\n\n3. Do you cook your own meals or is there some sort of a meal plan or cafeteria? If you cook your meals, how do you have time if you take that many classes?\n\nMost students cook their own meals while at Sciences Po. The Reims campus now has a cafe that serves light refreshments like sandwiches and pastries. During the day, there are also several bakeries around campus that sell sandwiches, quiches, and other lunch foods. There is no meal plan like at a traditional 4-year American college however. Generally, students live close to campus and it is easy to go home for lunch. Otherwise, students will grab something near campus, or bring their own food for lunch.\n\n4. How are the integration efforts by Columbia for years 3 and 4 students? By then most Columbia students have already forged their friendships and I am afraid it will be hard to widen your circle of friends outside of the dual degree proram and become a \"normal\" Columbia student. Is it hard to join clubs especially when other students are on their 3rd year in a particular club. Do they look at you as an outsider?\n\nI think the Dual BA makes you a Columbia student - that is part of your Columbia story and experience. Especially being at GS, where students have a varied background of experiences - from serving in the military, to being professional actors and dancers, athletes, being student parents, being dual degree students, etc - you find a place where you belong. The GS community has been incredibly welcoming and open in my experience, especially since it is smaller than the other schools. Dual BA students also easily make friends with students from Columbia College and Barnard because we are the same age. By joining clubs and extra-curriculars, even making friends in class, you'll find a community of friends from the other schools. In my experience though, GS is truly suited for Dual BA students because our advisors work primarily with dual degree students throughout GS, and know how to support our needs and goals. The advisors visit the students in France at least twice a year to plan out their time at Columbia, and are always available via Skype and e-mail.\n\n5. Do you have access to all what Columbia offers like any Columbia College student? Is The School of General Studies held to the same esteem as Columbia College? Do students mingle and look at each other as equal?\n\n^Similar to above answer. All students have access to the same courses, libraries, career services, etc and graduate with the same degree. Each school has its own student council that will plan events or opportunities particular to its own school.\n\n6. Do you have access to any course you wish to take as any other student?\n\nYes, we can take classes at Columbia and Barnard, and even in the graduate schools with certain instructor permission.\n\n7. How do employers look at dual degree graduates? Do they consider it similar to a regular Columbia (or other same caliber colleges) double major grads? In other words does the dual degree give you an edge or not especially that it is granted by GS?\n\nIn my experience, the Dual BA Program has made me stand out as a candidate because there is a rich story behind it. Undergraduate dual degree programs are rare- especially between two prestigious schools, across two continents - and it is a very interesting talking point to employers. It reflects the student's ability to adapt and the desire to challenge themselves. There is no distinction between degrees that GS and CC students receive - on a resume, both will say \"Columbia University\", and won't specify the school. For those interested in international careers, the Dual BA is very well suited and respected.\n\nHope these answers are helpful - please let me know if you have any follow-up questions!\n\nLaetitia ", "\n\nhere are my stats!\n\nint'l student living in one of East Asian countries\nTook GED after dropping out my high school\nage: 22\nGender: Male\nCurrent University: Top 70 public university\nCollege gpa: 3.85 (31credits)\n\nNew SAT I :1480 (790 Math 690 Reading and Writing)\nSAT II: Biology (700), Math2c (760), World History (700)\nAP: Calculus AB (5)\nHigh school GPA (out of 4.0): about 3.8\nECs: not impressive, just a few clubs\nJob/Work Experience: nope\nEssays: Not strong but talked about my meditation experience and excellent curriculum of Columbia\nRecommendations: two from excellent professors\n\nhope this helps everyone!

I also talked a bit about why Columbia would be the best for my major (Art History).

Im currently 23, female, and intl student\nAnd the only other academic credentials or stats that i have apart from that is my SATs which i just took last year, with basically no studying or preparation ( i was initally being recruited as an athlete so i was told that with a certain score i would be ok for specific colleges) I got a 670 CR, 470 math which totally blows haha, and 620 writing.

The following year I transferred to a state college where I did not do well. My grades there were abysmal, as I was dealing with some stuff in my personal life during my time at community college and the university.

Here's my stats as well--since it is currently trending, after all--and please don't hesitate to let me know what you think!\n\n- 6 years off to serve in the military (very outstanding military career, if I do say so myself  )\n- High school GPA: 3.5/3.8 weighted\n- CC GPA: 4.0 (35 credits)\n- SAT/ACT: 1750 (took > 7 years ago)\n- Part-time job: Certified Pilates instructor & physical trainer\n- EC: Phi Theta Kappa Member\n- Volunteer: San Diego Humane Society, San Diego Zoo, and Labrador Retrievers & More\n- Awards: Dean's list\n- Fun facts: I speak 4 languages fluently; English, Tagalog, Japanese, Bisayan; and was born in a different country where English wasn't my first language. I've also traveled around the world (where I received most of my \"non-traditional\" education from) and went on 2 grueling deployments while serving in the military\n\nIf accepted to GS, I'm hoping to major in Biology so that I may be able to apply my degree, as well as my 6+ years experience in the military and Pilates industry, to go to PT school. \n\nGood luck to everyone! ", "\nHey guys,\n\nI met with a Senior Admissions Officer about this program - Erica Rosen - and it's true that they're working out some things for themselves still. She had to research a bit to respond to some of my questions.\n\nHere's what I learned: You cannot apply to both the dual BA program and regular GS (kind of duh) BUT if you are not accepted to dual BA, the admissions committee can decide to refer you to GS. This is important to me because it seems that the dual BA program will be very competitive and my primary goal is to go to Columbia. I am a transfer student from the University of Southern California, and she does not know how transfer credit will factor in. I'm prepared for the situation that none of my transfer credits will apply and that I will go through the entire four years of the program. Also, it is unclear if you can take some classes in French at any of the three campuses (important to me because I speak French and would love to be immersed in it all the time). That will be something of a special request once you are actually there. Finally, she does not know how many students they will accept, but it will be a small program the first year. I read a published article stating 60 students from each university will be sent to each other (so 60 will be accepted by Columbia and start immediately at Sciences Po, 60 from France will be accepted by Sciences Po and start at Columbia) but randompiglet says they will only accept 30 so now I don't know. 30 sounds way worse to me \n\nI'm curious about the backgrounds of the other applicants here on this thread? Like I said, I'm a transfer from the University of Southern California and I'm on a leave of absence for one year. I have an 3.7 GPA and good SATs, Erica just expressed concern that I am a \"nontraditional\" student since I am so young - 19 (I went to university early, when I had just turned 17) - but I have no doubt that I am, so I'm just working to get that across clearly in my essay. I'm interested in the dual BA because I want to work in diplomacy one day, and also be fluent in French.\n\nBonne chance ", "\nI was accepted yesterday. I applied on the June 1st deadline and one of my recs came in on June 21st.\n\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (2 sems at a community college)\nSAT: Over 1550 out of 1600\nECs: Bad\n\nI think my essay was good, but I haven't been particularly accomplished in my life so far. Good luck everyone! ", "\nSure thing! Here's my stats:\n\n- 6 years off to serve active duty in the military \n- High school GPA: 3.5/3.8 weighted\n- CC GPA: 4.0 (35 credits)\n- SAT/ACT: 1750 (took once over 7 years ago)\n- Part-time job: Certified Pilates instructor & physical trainer (working on my yoga certification)\n- EC: Phi Theta Kappa Member & Veteran's Honor Society Club\n- Volunteer: San Diego Humane Society, San Diego Zoo, and Labrador Retrievers & More\n- Awards: Dean's List\n- Fun facts: I speak 4 languages fluently; English, Tagalog, Japanese, Bisayan; and was born in a different country where English wasn't my first language.

", "\nHey all,\n\nJust got accepted today! I had applied before the Jan. 15th deadline but my admissions decision was delayed a week for a certain reason. I wanted to share my stats and story because everyone who had posted theirs before me had helped me gain a better understanding of how the process works and who has a chance at getting in. It would only be fair to give back to this community.\n\n\nMy Story:\n\nAttended a 4 yr public state university after high school and did really, really bad. .27 Cumulative GPA over 2 semester's.\n\nLeft school for a few years and then attempted to get back on track at a community college. Once again, did very poorly so I stopped attending altogether (1 C and a few F's and W's). Then a few things happened in my life that forced me to reassess who I was and where I wanted to go in life. Returned to the same community college and performed very well. 1 C the first semester back (Drawing), 1 B, and then 16 A's in a row. However, last summer, I had a personal issue come up which caused me to finish a stats course with a D. I am currently taking the same stats course now and am expecting to finish with an A.\n\nStats:\n.27 GPA, 19 Credits (1st school, 4 yr)\n3.74 GPA, 58 Credits (community college, brought down by 2 C's as explained in my story and 1 \nMajor: Philosophy\nEssay: Wrote strongly about how philosophy changed my life and renewed my love for learning\n\nGood luck to everyone in the future! ", "\n@FearTheFeathers You won't like what you see.\n\nGPA: 3.9 51 Credits Completed\nSAT 1660/2400 (My high school score 7 years ago. I heard a rumor that the average range is 2100+, and I can score 1950+ on practice tests, but a recruiter insisted it was just a checkmark to see if you can read English. Challenge accepted.)\nEssays: They must have been good. I gave each my best effort. I only worked on them for a few days though.\nRecommendations: Great. My boss wrote my first letter. I didn't know it at the time, but he taught at Columbia for 10 years. My economics club advisor wrote my second.\nExtra-Curriculars:\n-Air Force Veteran\n(I think this is the big one as GS was primarily founded to educate returning servicemen from World War II. The veteran community is overwhelmingly supportive.)\n-Economics & Finance Club\u2014Treasurer -(GS seems to like this activity. Three of my friends got in.)\n-College National Fed Challenge-BMCC Representative\n-National Anthem & Alma Mater Performer: BMCC 50th Commencement at Madison Square Garden\n-Official United States National Anthem and Italian National Anthem Performer for Aviano Air Base, Italy, 2013.\n-BMCC Art & Music Department-Clerical Assistant\n-Various stage manager volunteer work at community theaters and Air Force \"Tops in Blue\" performances.\n\nTo be honest I wasn't that interested in the school, and I even talked about that in my essay. At my school, a lot of students want in for the 'brand.' Even my professors pressured me to apply because it was prestigious. I really just want to study the economics of the art, entertainment, and cultural heritage industries; I already possess a lot of books on the subject. In my essays, I talked about how I need exposure to aesthetics and the axiology of art\u2014emphasizing how this program could help me. I helped my friend who got into the Financial Economics program with her essays last year. I believe that if you are genuine, reveal your weaknesses, and explain how different events have shaped you as a person, you are a strong candidate.\n\n@CUSOGS\nRD. I was notified on December 10th. I didn't submit the second part of the application until November 28th. I told you I was surprised. ", "\nI have also been lurking in this forum since I submitted my app in January. I got accepted (yay!!), so for those of you who are interested in my stats/story:\n\nI'm 24. I am originally from Mexico City, I dropped out of high school (went only for a year) because it seemed like a waste of money and time; I was NOT into formal education. I also dropped out because I wanted to pursue my passion (film/photography) and so I went to photography school for three years.\n\nI moved here a little over 4 years ago with no high school diploma. I was severely depressed for two years and so I did nothing during that period of time except for two continuing ed courses in photography (took them at SVA).\n\nAfter two years, I finally decided to get my life together and I enrolled at a summer-long course that was designed to prepare students for the TASC (formerly known as GED) exam. After a month, I was told I was ready to take it; I passed and a week after, I was already in the admissions office of my community college. Funny thing is that I just wanted to have a high school diploma and my plans never included going to college.\n\nSo then I went to community college and I excelled during my first semester, which was surprising due to the fact that I had been out of school for over 5 years at that point. As of now, I have completed 51 college credits, my GPA is 3.97, and I will be graduating in May.\n\nI have taken approx. 19 honors credits, I'm a PTK member and executive board member of the Honors Association. I've been part of several other EC activities, including being editor-in-chief of two newsletters (one for the Honors Association and the other for the feminist club on campus) and presenting a paper at the Beacon Conference. Relevant employment includes working as a writing, cinema studies (my major) and mathematics tutor in my school's tutoring center for over 2 years now.\n\nIn my essay, I talked about all those things, why I chose to study film, and how regardless of my disdain for formal education during those years, I've always sought knowledge independently. Honestly, my essay wasn't anything extraordinary, I just talked about my life story.\n\nOh, I also had to take the TOEFL iBT (scored 113) because I didn't attend secondary school here.\n\nMy top advise for prospective students is: be authentic in your essay and don't forget to mention what you think you can bring to CU. :-)\n\nFor those who have already been admitted, have you guys been able to log into the financial aid portal?

I was an exchange student in Minnesota in 2007 where I had a very high GPA and was an honor student. I am really surprised that I got in, but I think it was a combination of my recommendations, my essay and my overall life experience, since my grades from Denmark wasn't the best.

She said that my admissions exam scores were competitive, with a strong score in technical writing; she mentioned that my autobiographical essay was wonderful to read and that they were impressed with my ability to balance academics and family life. I have kids whom I've homeschooled and was 9 months pregnant while sitting for the exam; I also maintained a 4.0 while taking a full schedule of 5 classes, most of which were honors courses while being pregnant and giving birth.

I would do as @DualDegreeSeeker suggested. Email them reiterating your interest in the program - tell them it's your dream choice and that you will go if you are accepted off the waitlist (assuming that's true). But depending on the campus, there MAY be a fair chance they will take a couple waitlist people, as I know there will probably be a couple people who don't choose the program for financial or other reasons.\n\nAnd FYI I'm pretty sure most of us felt as if our interviews were really bad, haha - that's mostly because of the poker face and the grilling the Sciences Po interviewer gives you. I thought I totally blew my chances at getting into the program after my interview.\n\n@reims17 To add on to some of what @vossari said:\n5. Apparently Columbia is pretty generous with the grade conversion from Sciences Po, which gives us a nice advantage in terms of GPA when we arrive at Columbia. Actually the valedictorian of the School of General Studies last year was a Dual BA student. And Patrick Martinez said the Dual BA students have the highest GPA out of all of the students at Columbia (I guess average GPA of Dual BA students compared to students at other schools?).\n6. Yeah, you don't have to take any classes in French (except the required French class if you aren't fluent). BUT you certainly can take classes in French if you're so inclined! At least in Le Havre, if you are B2 French or higher, you have to take your elective in French OR a second language from the region of focus (so Asian language for us). If your French is A1 to B1, you don't have to take a French elective (and you probably should not, as it will be very difficult for you) or a second language unless you want to. \n0  \u00b7  Reply \u00b7 Share on Facebook \n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n#146 \n\n\nHagboorn \n\nRegistered User Posts: 7 New Member \n\n\n\nMay 2015 \n\n\n\n\n\nHi everyone, I just got accepted into Columbia University GS.\nAbout me:\nmale, 23 yrs. foreign student, GPA 4.0, and Student body President of my community college.\nI also got into UC Berkeley, School of business, which offered me full ride.\nHowever, Columbia has not told me how much scholarship I am going to get.\n\nI have 2 questions:\nFirst, has anyone heard anything about their scholarship?\nSecond, which university would you guys go if you were in my place?

I also attended two admissions events last month and kept in contact with the representative. That helped! Keep bugging them so they remember you!\n\nI look forward to meeting all of you soon!

The information session was extremely worthwhile. The tour was well conducted, but was of little use to me personally.\n- After speaking with an admissions manager during said information session, it was abundantly clear to me that test scores matter little in comparison to the essay, LOR's, and what you bring to the table as a non-traditional student; thus, I did not elect to take the GSAE or retake any standardized tests despite my SAT score being over a decade old.\n- I submitted a resume even though it was optional. My resume was pretty much a more easily-digestible version of my DD214 and military service history.\n- I did not have any extracurricular activities or community service listed on my application.\n- I did not use service-to-school or any such similar program, though I do hear that they are indeed awesome and quite a valuable resource.\n\nI believe having solid LOR's and furnishing a well written essay that communicates what drives you as a person, what fuels your passions, and your story/unique experiences that have brought you to this point in your life are monumental towards getting accepted. I have no doubt that those two components of my application are by far what carried me the most.\n\nGood luck to those who are still waiting to hear back; looking forward to meeting everyone in the Fall!

I was wondering whether anybody here (current GS student or otherwise), could comment on my suitability/chances of getting accepted.\n\nFirstly - I am from the UK. So our school system is a quite different - there isn't really such thing as GPA for a start. Just to give you a really brief overview of the UK system:\n\nSchool is mandatory up to the age of 16, where you do your GCSEs (general certificate of secondary education). Most students take about 9 subjects (the usual suspects - math, sciences, history, geography etc.) (Graded A* to F)\n\nIf you want to continue education 'Post16' - you typically go to what we call college. At college, you specialise in 3-4 subjects to attain 'A Levels'. A Levels take 2 years.\n\nThen, if you have A-Levels, you can then apply to do a variety of undergraduate degrees at university.\n\nOK - so sorry for the background info, but I'm guessing you won't all necessarily be totally familiar with the UK system.\n\nOnto me. I left school at 16, after my GCSEs. I took 11, and got 5 A*s and 6As.\n\nI started college, but left when I decided to start my own business. We're a tech company that make interactive lottery games. The secondary reason I left college was that I was, at that point in my life, fed up with education - I wanted to get out there!\n\nThe business has been pretty successful, but it's a long road - we're not there yet. We employ 40 people in London (ranging from software architects to graphic designers), and we're in the process of opening an office in NYC.\n\nThe reason I want to go to CGS is that having left school at 16, I am lacking some really core skills that'll allow me to stay at the top of the game when it comes to my business. I've got some matter between my ears, but no grounding from which to excel in the increasingly fast-paced business world that I find myself in.\n\nI guess I'm looking for clarification on a couple of things;\n\n-Does the fact that I haven't stretched myself academically since I was 16 (I'm 23 now), and therefore feel academically rusty, matter?\n\n-Do most applicants have education at a much higher level, i.e. beyond high school?\n\n-Would they likely want to see me first get some good grades at a lesser school in the US to build up a more common GPA that they recognise?\n\nThanks for any help you can give - and sorry for the essay.\n\nOh - and I'd be considering a Econ-PoliSci major, providing my quant is up to scratch.\n\nAnd one last thing - I would be paying for my education using my own cash, cash that I have earned from the success thus far of my business.\n\nCheers ", "\nAccepted\n27 y/o\nApp Type: Transfer\nCollege/ Country: Collin College\nCollege GPA: 4.0/4.0\nHS GPA:4.0 (Homeschooled)\nTesting: GSAE\nECs: Phi Theta Kappa\n\nWrote my essay about my experience as a foster care provider for individuals with autism and how they have inspired me to further my education.

Are some areas better than others? Would you recommend a homestay (for ease and thriftiness- I am already fluent in French)?\n3. What are internships like? I know that 1 is required the first summer, but do most people do any more?\n4. How long are your breaks/how often do you have days off?\n5. How does the French grading scale convert/carry over into the second two years-- is it completely separate (separate GPA)?\n6.

And I'm happy to help - looking forward to meeting you too \n\n@xoxoPaulina Some of us were surprised to learn our program even has a waitlist; I guess it's because the program is getting more and more applicants but staying the same size. I would do as @DualDegreeSeeker suggested. Email them reiterating your interest in the program - tell them it's your dream choice and that you will go if you are accepted off the waitlist (assuming that's true). But depending on the campus, there MAY be a fair chance they will take a couple waitlist people, as I know there will probably be a couple people who don't choose the program for financial or other reasons.\n\nAnd FYI I'm pretty sure most of us felt as if our interviews were really bad, haha - that's mostly because of the poker face and the grilling the Sciences Po interviewer gives you. I thought I totally blew my chances at getting into the program after my interview.\n\n@reims17 To add on to some of what @vossari said:\n5. Apparently Columbia is pretty generous with the grade conversion from Sciences Po, which gives us a nice advantage in terms of GPA when we arrive at Columbia. Actually the valedictorian of the School of General Studies last year was a Dual BA student. And Patrick Martinez said the Dual BA students have the highest GPA out of all of the students at Columbia (I guess average GPA of Dual BA students compared to students at other schools?).\n6. Yeah, you don't have to take any classes in French (except the required French class if you aren't fluent). BUT you certainly can take classes in French if you're so inclined! At least in Le Havre, if you are B2 French or higher, you have to take your elective in French OR a second language from the region of focus (so Asian language for us). If your French is A1 to B1, you don't have to take a French elective (and you probably should not, as it will be very difficult for you) or a second language unless you want to.

But GS is GS because they don't just blindly follow numbers like that. They care about your story. A 4.0 taking one motorcycle maintenance class per semester isn't very impressive, while a 3.6 taking 21 credits of difficult classes with a kid and a full time job is remarkable.

And here is why:\n\n- As a California Resident, UC's HEAVILY favor California Community College students versus any one else outside the state. A student with a 3.7 with barely any EC's from a CCC WILL be accepted over a student with a 3.9 with lots of EC's from New York. In fact ( although I hate to use analogies for obvious reasons ) , FOUR of my friends from a CCC that had a high 3.6 with barely any extracurriculars got in to the College of Letter and Science & the college of Engineering. Why? Well, this has alot to do with overpopulation and the fact that the state has an extremely high unemployment rate ( probably because there is so much fun stuff to do that people tend to forget about school at a young age plus too many people moving into California ). The main reason I actually moved out of California was because I could not concentrate in school. In fact, most UC's ( not including Berkeley and UCLA) have TAG ( Transfer Acceptance Agreements ) where all you need is to take \"X\" amount of courses and maintain a 3.0 would constitute an automatic acceptance. Moral of the story, as a CCC student you dont have to be \"smart\" per se to get into a UC like \" non- haas \"Berkeley. Honestly, in a state where a 3.0 is looked at by your peers as \"phenomenal,\" you just need to be able to follow directions and maintain a certain GPA and your basically a shoe in.\n\nIn Addition, from what I am reading on the forum, to gain acceptance to GS means to be not JUST non-traditional, in most cases the odds are IN FAVOR of EXTREMELY non-traditional; i.e Campaigning for some hot shot Senator or whatever for a couple years, Dodging bullets as a Green Buret, or raised in extreme poverty while raising children while maintaining a high GPA.\n\nSo as with Berkeley, in most cases, you need the minimum GPA and a few clubs here and there. Where Columbia GS you dont neccessarily need a high GPA as much as you need a great story ( although in plenty of cases it appears most have great GPA's)\n\nYes, Berk has a 21 % acceptance rate, but I am willing to bet that plenty of those applicants ( especially CCC students because they like to party, bon fires etc etc ) have Gpa's below 3.6. In california, UCB and UCLA are those dream schools that people just apply to any way because, \" Why not? , Im applying to UCI and UCSD, why not UCB for the heck of it?\"\n\nIn a state where UC grads come at a dime a dozen, I can totally see why even a Columbia GS education would be a wise investment; small class sizes, and besides the Columbia name would be an eye opener in a sea of UC resumes in California.

She basically asked me what I was doing for the past years, how I was doing in college now, why I chose the major Econ+Math, and what I'll be doing if I was not accepted(duh!). The decision came out really fast, within two days or so. I was so excited but still had a week of hell during the coming finals, as they asked for the final transcript.\n\nHope my story helps.

Ivonne Rojas is a very nice lady, with lots of pertinent questions!

Even though my GPA at my CC is good (3.83) and I have an AA degree with Economics/International Poli-sci classes they were still worried about me being able to handle the workload...\nI guess my answer was good because she said \"we can definitely see that you have a very strong and hard work ethic\"\n\nBUT (there's always a but)\n\nI feel that I could have convinced her more. I was not the \"passionate\" student that was trying to strongly prove a point and show determination. I was this normal person having a normal conversation, answering questions about why my not so good grades in high school and why since I moved to the USA I'm this successful, perfectionist and workaholic person... (my answer was maturity).\n\nShe also asked me the classes that were the hardest. I was honest and told her that my English comp II honors class was the hardest (the only B I have) because even after three years living in the US we can still spot the detail that shows I'm not a native English speaker.\n\nShe said that Econ was heavy in math and that so far I did not have many math classes... which is definitely true even though with work I don't feel it will be an issue in the end.\n\nFinally, the last question just killed me! \"What if you're not accepted to Columbia? What is you backup plan?\"\nI answered I was already admitted in the university I'm currently working at (University of Central Florida). I said I would go there, that my major would be Economics with an International Business minor.

She then worked full time for five years as a waiter at a casino and a few odd jobs here and there.\nIn 2006, she decided to go back to school and in her fist semester back, she did ok with a 3.0 GPA but while going to school and working at the same time, the apartment she was living at evicted her because she was not able to pay the monthly rent as she was putting most of her limited budget into school, and food. Even financial aid was not enough to put her through. She then had to live in a homeless shelter close to campus for six months and at the same time, she still went to school and worked full time in the transfer center trying to put her life back together. It was during her stay in the homeless shelter that she got interested in anthropology as she was exposed to different people and cultures. She still managed to get a 3.0 average during her stay in the shelter. Her family tried to help her during the ordeal she had to go through but it still was not enough as they were going through with financial problems of their own.

I became so attached to the program that I habitually went on forums/websites to \"shorten\" the wait before interview decisions. Now, it just feels awkward with reality hitting hard and stopping me from doing such things.\n\nI guess the admissions committee did have viable reason (I actually wish that it's possible to ask them what the specific causes were that led to the rejection). Also, what makes this all the more easier to digest is that both of you, based on your posts in this forum, seem like good, interested candidates for the program who do better in holistic admissions like me (i.e. relatively low GPAs/scores but great essays, extracurriculars, and recs.) It helps me know that I wasn't an outlier in the type of people being rejected.\n\nPerhaps -- again perhaps -- it is possible to appeal the rejection if the program allows it.

Very good essay (2900 words).\n\n\nEDIT: I've had rejections or deferrals (i.e., rejection until after this semester grades) from almost all the other schools I applied to (one hasn't gotten back to me yet). There's hope yet for some of you!  ", "\nYeah ton, it's definitely possible I'll apply again for the spring semester. And you're right, I'll pretty much have everything already ready to go sans the app fee. Thank you for the support man, I really appreciate it.\nRandom, I gotta be honest with you.. I think I know what it was. Some years back, during my 'cowboy' days, I had a run-in with the law that had me do 5 months in Riker's Island. Crazy, I know, but luckily for my sake, I did everything I was supposed to do in terms of my probation afterwards, and didn't end up with a felony on my record. In the midst of the whole ordeal, I stopped and took a look at how I was living, and decided that I couldn't go on like that. So I truly and completely started doing the right things, academic and otherwise, and never looked back.\nNow, this might sound stupid to some, but I touched on the situation in my essay. Why? Because it was a building block for who I am today.. An essential piece in making me the highly motivated, 'shoot for the moon' kind of person I've become. I know I could've omitted it all out and slyly worked around it, but after living with something to hide for so long, I just don't like to be like that anymore. I'm not ashamed of where I come from. And in fact, I'm proud. I'm proud that I came this far. 'Cause at 1 time, I had it all - loving support, smarts, talent, ambition - without the scars. I even skipped 4th grade, for God's sake. But somewhere along the line, my immaturity got the best of me and I threw it all away. Miraculously, though, I was able to gain it all back. Through years of hard work. And so when I went for my interview, the lady asked me about it all, and I was very honest about it. I'm sure, though, it was something that didn't appeal to her.\nI just wish she knew and trusted the real me. Who I am; and who I was as a kid. Because If she did, I really feel like I'd be in. I thought my GPA, community service, and overall contrition for said situation in the interview would be enough to attest to my qualifications, but apparently not. And that's the baggage I have to carry, at least for now still.\nI know some people might say, 'Hey buddy, you get arrested, and you think you're getting into GS? Are you kidding me?' And to those people, primarily I'll say it was worth a shot. Why not? I've been doing everything I should have been doing academically the last few years.. My favorite motto is 'shoot for the moon.. If you miss, you're still amongst those stars.' So I gave it a chance. But secondly, I'll also say 'I hear you.' I hear where you're coming from, and I understand your position. I say that because I feel like the amount of people that have made mistakes like me, only to truly redeem themselves morally and otherwise, and go to live productive lives, is slim to none. So as soon as some people hear the word 'arrested,' they almost automatically assume a person will always be that certain way, and attach that stigma to him as well. It's okay, though. That's part of that baggage I was talking about. And it's what makes me strive harder and harder each and every day. With this rejection, I kind of feel like Tom Brady getting drafted in the 6th round. Somebody who knows they have talent and can confidently perform at a very high level that gets overlooked. I just hope that you Random, and everyone else in this forum that is waiting for an answer, get in. It's a great school, and obviously everyone that gets to go there is very fortunate and talented. But if you don't, I'm sure you know that you still have a very real and good chance to succeed. As long as you work hard, develop strong bonds, and continue on the path that you're on - because if you're applying to GS with any realistic shot of getting in, you're already on the right one.. you shouldn't have a problem. And like I wrote in my last post, I just truly wish everyone the best, and hope that you all get to end up where you wanna be.
